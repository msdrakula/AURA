 If you have problems with your Collaborator server, try the following:


- Professional Run the Collaborator health check.
- Check that your server domain resolves to your Collaborator server's IP address.

## Collaborator health check

 To access the Collaborator health check in Burp Suite Professional, go to the **Collaborator** page in the **Settings** dialog, and click **Run health check**.

## Server domain resolution

 The health check may fail if the server domain doesn't resolve to your Collaborator server IP address. The following process can help you troubleshoot this:


1.

 Check that the NS record for your domain resolves to the expected name servers. For example:
  `dig burpcollaborator.example.com NS +noall +answer +short
ns1.burpcollaborator.example.com`
1.

 Check that the above entry has a corresponding A/AAAA record that resolves to the Collaborator's IP addresses. For example:
  `dig ns1.burpcollaborator.example.com A +noall +answer +short
192.168.0.1`
1.

 Check that the public IP address returns when you resolve a subdomain of the Collaborator server. For example:
  `dig randomsubdomain.burpcollaborator.example.com A +noall +answer +short
ns1.burpcollaborator.example.com
192.168.0.1`
1. Check the Collaborator's logs and configuration.
1. Check that your DNS port is open for UDP traffic. This is port 53, unless you changed the default ports. For more information, see
