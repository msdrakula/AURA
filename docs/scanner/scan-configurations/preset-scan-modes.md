 Burp Scanner's scan modes are predefined collections of scan settings. They offer a quick way to adjust how the scan balances speed and coverage.


 There are four preset scan modes:


- **Lightweight** is the fastest scan mode, with scans capped at 15 minutes in length. It is useful in situations where you need fast feedback on a target.
- **Fast** is intended to give you a general overview of a site's security posture quickly.
- **Balanced** is useful for general-purpose scanning. It is designed to give a good balance between coverage and speed.
- **Deep** is intended to give you an in-depth look at a site's security posture. The time taken to run a scan using the Deep configuration depends heavily on the site's size and complexity.

## Using presets in Burp Suite Professional

## Setting preset scan modes for folders

 In Burp Suite DAST, you can select a preset scan mode for folders, subfolders, and sites. If you select a preset scan mode at multiple levels, Burp Scanner only runs the preset scan mode that you set at the lowest level.


 Preset scan modes in Burp Suite DAST can't be customized. For more control, create a custom scan configuration.
