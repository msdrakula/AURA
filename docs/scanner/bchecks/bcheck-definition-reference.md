## Metadata

 Contains information about the check itself. The metadata object is mandatory for all BChecks and must be placed at the very start of the definition.


#### metadata
`
metadata:
  language: v2-beta
  name: "Simple SQLi"
  description: "Tests insertion points for basic SQLi"
  author: "Peter Wiener"
  tags: "sql", "active", "sql-injection"
                `
| **
 Property
 **  | **

## Control flow

 These keywords control the flow of execution for the definition.


#### run for each

 Declares an array variable that can be iterated over. When the variable is called the check runs once for each item in the array. The variable declared has outer scope.


 The `run for each` keyword is optional. If used, you must place it before the `given...then` statement in your definition.
  `
run for each:
variable_name = "variable value 1", "variable value 2", etc.
                `

#### Example

 The example declares a variable called `url_array` listing three URLs. This could be useful if you are writing a check that needs to run the same test against multiple URLs (for example, adding each in turn as the `Origin` header in a CORS misconfiguration check).
  `
run for each:
url_array =
null,
"http://example.com",
`https://{random_str(5)}{base.response.url}`
                    `

#### define

 Declares variables with inner scope. The `define` keyword is optional. If used, you must place it before the `given...then` statement in your definition.
  `
define:
  variable_name = "variable_content"
                `

#### Example

 The example calls the `generate_collaborator_address()` function to generate a new Burp Collaborator address, and stores it in a variable called collaborator_address.
  `
define:
  collaborator_address = {generate_collaborator_address()}
                    `

#### given...then

 Defines when the check runs, based on the content being audited.
  `given [response|request|host|path] | [ [any|query|header|body|cookie]* + insertion point] then`

 Each BCheck must have a single `given / then` statement containing:


 EITHER one of the following:


- `given response then` - The check runs once for each response audited.
- `given request then` - The check runs once for each request audited.
- `given host then` - The check runs once for each host audited.
- `given path then` - The check runs once for each unique path audited.

 OR one of the following insertion point keywords:


- `given any insertion point then` - The check runs once for each insertion point (of any type) audited. Burp Scanner also uses this default option if you do not specify an insertion point type (i.e. you use `given insertion point`).
- `given query insertion point then` - The check runs once for each query audited.
- `given header insertion point then` - The check runs once for each header audited.
- `given body insertion point then` - The check runs once for each body content audited.
- `given cookie insertion point then` - The check runs once for each cookie audited.

 You can use the `or` keyword to combine insertion points. For example:


- `given query or body insertion point` then - The check runs once for each query or body content audited.
- `given header or cookie insertion point then` - The check runs once for each header or cookie audited.

## Conditionals

 These keywords control actions that happen as a result of a set condition. You can only use conditional keywords inside a `given...then` statement.


#### if... then

 Executes an action if a set condition is met. Requires the following:


- A condition.
- An action.
- An `end if` keyword.
`
if [condition] then
  [action]
end if
                `

#### Example

 If the latest response contains an Apache Struts version number then report an issue:
  `
if {latest.response} matches "Apache Struts [\d\s\.]+" then
  report issue:
    severity: info
    confidence: certain
    detail: "Disclosed Apache Server"
    remediation: "Do not reveal error messages"
end if
                    `

#### else if... then

 Used within an `if` statement. Executes an action if the preceding condition is false and the `else if` condition is true. You can use multiple `else if` statements within a BCheck.
  `
    if [condition 1] then
      [action 1]
      else if [condition 2] then
       [action 2]
    end if
                `

#### Example

 If the check results in the Collaborator receiving DNS interactions then report an issue with firm confidence. Otherwise, check whether the Collaborator has received any SMTP interactions. If it has, report an issue with tentative confidence.
  `
    if dns interactions then
      report issue:
        severity: high
        confidence: firm
      else if smtp interactions then
        report issue:
          severity: high
          confidence: tentative
    end if
                    `

#### else then

 Used within an `if` statement. Executes an action if the statement's condition and the condition of any preceding `else / if` statements are not met.
  `
    if [condition] then
      [action]
      else then
        [action 2]
    end if
                `

#### Example

 If the latest response is not identical to the base response but does have the same HTTP status code, report an issue with firm confidence. Otherwise, report an issue with tentative confidence.
  `
    if {latest.response} differs from {base.response} and {latest.response.status_code} is {base.response.status_code} then
      report issue:
        severity: high
        confidence: firm
      else then
        report issue:
          severity: high
          confidence: tentative
    end if
                    `

#### end if

 Denotes the end of an if statement.
  `
if [condition] then
  [action]
end if
                `

### Conditions

 You can use the following conditions in `if` statements:


- `{X} matches "[regex]"` - True if X matches the regex provided.
- `{X} differs from {Y}` - True if response X differs from response Y.
- `{X} in {Y}` - True if Y contains X (for example, Y could be a response and X could be a header to search for within that response).
- `{X} is {Y}` - True if the provided parameters are identical.
- `any interactions` - True if Burp Collaborator has received any interactions.
- `dns interactions` - True if Burp Collaborator has received any DNS interactions.
- `http interactions` - True if Burp Collaborator has received any HTTP interactions.
- `smtp interactions` - True if Burp Collaborator has received any SMTP interactions.

 You can also combine and modify conditions:


- `{condition} and {condition}` - True if both conditions are true.
- `{condition} or {condition}` - True if one or both of the conditions is true.
- `not({condition})` - True if the condition is not true.

### Brackets

 You can use brackets in conditions to refine the flow of logic on your checks.


 For example, `A or B and C` creates a condition that evaluates to true if one of the following conditions is met:


- `A` is true.
- Both `B` and `C` are true.

 However, `(A or B) and C` creates a condition that evaluates to true if both of the following conditions is met:


- Either `A` or `B` is true.
- `C` is true.

## Actions

 These keywords prompt Burp Scanner to perform a particular action.


#### Note

 Some of these keywords can only be used in conjunction with certain insertion points. For more information on defining which insertion points the check logic is used on, see [ given...then](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/bchecks/bcheck-definition-reference#control-flow).


#### send request

 Sends a request including the specified information. Can be used with all scan check modes except `given response`.


#### Note

 All request properties default to `replacing` if an action keyword is not provided. For example:
  `
headers:
  "name_of_header1": "value of header1",
  "name_of_header2": "value of header2"
                    `

 is the same as
  `
replacing headers:
  "name_of_header1": "value of header1",
  "name_of_header2": "value of header2"
                    `  `
send request [called request_name]:
  [appending|replacing] headers:
    "name_of_header1": "value of header1",
    "name_of_header2": "value of header2"
  removing headers:
    "name_of_header1",
    "name_of_header2"
  [appending|replacing] queries:
    "name_of_query_1=http://portswigger.net",
    "name_of_query_2=https://portswigger.net"
  removing queries:
    "name_of_query_1",
    "name_of_query_2"
  [appending|replacing] path: "/test"
  removing path
  [appending|replacing] method: "GET"
  removing method
  [appending|replacing] body: "contents of body"
  removing body

                `
| **
 Property
 **  | **
 Description
 **  | **

 **
|

`appending:`  |

Appends the specified payload to the request's payload set.  |

string / variable
|

`replacing:`  |

Replaces the request's existing payload set with the specified payload.  |

string / variable

#### report issue

 Causes Burp Scanner to report an issue. This terminates the BCheck, even if there are parts of the check that have not yet run.


 For example, consider the following BCheck:
  `
given host:
    send request:
        method: `GET`
        headers: `Host`: `{collaborator_address}`

    if dns interactions then
        report issue:
            severity: info
            confidence: certain
    end if

    if http interactions then
        report issue:
        severity: high
        confidence: certain
    end if
                `

 This check looks for first DNS and then HTTP interactions resulting from its Burp Collaborator payload. However, if the check finds a DNS interaction then it performs its first report issue action and does not subsequently report any HTTP interactions, even if there are HTTP interactions present.


#### report issue and continue

 Causes Burp Scanner to report an issue, then continue to run the BCheck. For example, consider the following BCheck:
  `
given host:
    send request:
        method: `GET`
        headers: `Host`: `{collaborator_address}`

    if dns interactions then
        report issue and continue:
            severity: info
            confidence: certain
    end if

    if http interactions then
        report issue:
        severity: high
        confidence: certain
    end if
            `

 This check looks for first DNS and then HTTP interactions resulting from its Burp Collaborator payload. If the check finds a DNS interaction then it performs its first report issue action. It then continues to run the check, and reports any subsequent HTTP interactions.


### Reporting issues

 You can report issues in BChecks using either the `report issue` or `report issue and continue` keywords. Both of these keyword blocks have the same properties.
 `
name:
severity:
confidence
remediation:
detail:
    `

#### Note

 You must use all of the below properties in the order specified. If you attempt to change the order (for example, by using a `name` property after a `severity` property), then your BCheck will fail validation.

| **Property**  | **Description**  | **Type**
| `name` | The name of the issue. | String
| `severity*` | The severity of the issue | `[info|low|medium|high]`
| `confidence*` | The level of confidence that the issue is present | `[certain|firm|tentative]`
| `remediation` | Remediation advice | String
| `detail` | Further information on the issue | String

### Issue naming

 All issues reported by BChecks have an issue type of `Declarative Scan Check Generated`. The name of the issue is calculated as follows:


-

If the relevant `report issue` or `report issue and continue` block has a `name` keyword, then this value is displayed in Burp as the issue name.
-

If the relevant `report issue` or `report issue and continue` block does not have a `name` keyword, then the issue name is taken from the BCheck's name metadata property.

 Adding a `name` keyword to the `report issue` block enables you to override the name used to report the issue in specific cases, which is useful when reporting different issue types from the same BCheck. For example, you might have a single BCheck that can report several different variations of similar bugs.


### Issue consolidation

 Consolidation is a process by which Burp aggregates duplicate issues to reduce noise in the UI.


 Burp applies its normal consolidation rules to issues returned by BChecks if both of the following conditions are true:


-

Both issues are reported by the same BCheck.
-

Both issues have the same name, regardless of whether this name is derived from metadata or the parameter in the `report issue` block.

## Reserved variables

 These keywords refer to specific request or response properties.


#### Note

 Make sure that you do not use these reserved property names when naming your own variables, as this will result in an error when the BCheck runs.


#### request / response

 These keywords refer to specific request or response properties. You can refer to either:


- `base` - The request sent and response received by Burp Scanner for the specified scan mode during crawling.
- `latest` - The most recent request / response pair for this scan mode.
- `{request_name}` - A specific request / response pair, named using the called keyword.
`
base|latest|{request_name} {
  response {
    status_code
    headers
    body
    http_version
  }
  request {
    method
    url {
      protocol
      host
      port
      path
      file
      query
    }
    http_version
    headers
    body
  }
}
                `

 flow keyword](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/bchecks/bcheck-definition-reference#control-flow).


## Functions

 These keywords perform a specific task when called.


 Note that all BCheck functions are denoted with curly braces `{}`.


#### random_str

`{random_str(int)}`

 Returns a random string of the specified length. The length must be between `0` and `9,999,999`. Entering 0 returns an empty string.

 Hashes the provided input using the MD5 hash function.


#### Example

`MD5("Hello") // 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592`

### Combining functions

 These functions can be nested if required. For example, the following function converts a variable to lowercase and then encodes it as base64 in one action:


`{base64_encode(to_lower(my_variable))}`

#### Note

 Make sure that you do not use these function names when naming variables, as this will result in an error when the BCheck runs.


## Misc

### Strings

 Both interpolatable and literal strings are accepted:


- Use double quotes (`""`) to denote literal strings - `"delete carlos"`
- Use backticks (````) to denote interpolatable strings - ``https://{random_str(5)}.com``

 When processing multiline strings, Burp Scanner replaces line endings with `\r\n` and trims trailing and leading whitespaces on each line (except for spaces right after the opening quote and before the closing quote).


 For example:
 `
"__GET / HTTP/1.1__
___Host: portswigger.net_"
    `

 becomes
 `
"__GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: portswigger.net__"
    `

 To explicitly specify trailing/leading whitespaces in interpolatable strings, use the `\s` character instead.


### Character escaping

 Use the `\` character within strings to escape characters.


 For example, `\{var}` is escaped, but `{var}` prints the value of `var`.


### Regex

 BChecks support Java-style regex.


`"2[0-9][0-9]"`

### Comments

 Use `#` to denote comment lines.


`#Hello`

### Special characters

 These characters can be used as part of an interpolatable string. For example, `'\s'` is interpreted as a space, but the literal string `"\s"` is interpreted as two separate characters.


- `\n` - new line
- `\r` - carriage return
- `\s` - space
- `\t` - tab
- `\b` - backspace
- `\f` - form feed

## BCheck structure

 There are some structure rules you need to follow in order to create valid BChecks:


- Each definition must start with a `metadata` object.
- Each definition must have exactly one `given... then` statement.
- Conditional statements can only appear in a `given... then` statement.
- Any `define` or `run for each` statement used must be placed after the `metadata` block but before the `given... then` statement.
- Variables declared using `run for each` have outer scope while those declared using define have inner scope. This means that you can't use a variable declared via `define` in a subsequent `run for each` statement.
