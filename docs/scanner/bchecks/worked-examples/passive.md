# Example passive check

 This check enables Burp Scanner to identify responses that disclose an AWS Access Key ID. It is an example of a passive check (that is, a check that inspects traffic passing through Burp without sending any additional requests).


 Specifically, the check examines each response for the regular expression `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`. If Burp Scanner finds a matching expression, it returns an issue indicating that the AWS key information has been disclosed.
 `
metadata:
    language: v2-beta
    name: "Response-level (passive) check"
    description: "Checks responses for leaked AWS Access Key IDs"
    tags: "passive"

given response then
    if {latest.response} matches "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}" then
        report issue:
            severity: high
            confidence: firm
            detail: "Leaked AWS Access Key ID."
            remediation: "Replace your keys and ensure keys are no longer revealed."
    end if
        `

#### Note

 Although this worked example identifies AWS key IDs, you could create a check that identifies any form of disclosed information by modifying the `matches` pattern.


## Step 1: Add metadata
`
metadata:
    language: v2-beta
    name: "Response-level (passive) check"
    description: "Checks responses for leaked AWS Access Key IDs"
    tags: "passive"
        `

 The definition starts with a `metadata` block. For more information on available metadata properties, see the reference documentation.


## Step 2: Add a string for the check to match
`
given response then
    if {latest.response} matches "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}" then
        `

 This example checks each response received using an if statement. The statement checks for the regex string `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`. This is the format that AWS key information would likely be presented in in a response.


## Step 3: Report the issue
`
report issue:
    severity: high
    confidence: firm
    detail: "Leaked AWS Access Key ID."
    remediation: "Replace your keys and ensure keys are no longer revealed."
        `

 If Burp Scanner finds a response containing AWS key information, then it reports an issue with a confidence level of `firm` and provides some simple remediation advice.


## Test this BCheck

 You can use a similar passive scan check to solve the [Information disclosure in error messages Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/information-disclosure/exploiting/lab-infoleak-in-error-messages) lab. Can you rewrite this BCheck to find the Apache Struts version number in the lab?
