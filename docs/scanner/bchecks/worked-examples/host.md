# Example host check

 This check enables Burp Scanner to see whether the target application exposes a Git directory. It is an example of a per-host check (that is, a check that runs once for each host scanned).


 The example scan check works by attempting to locate the host's `git-config` file. If the file is returned, Burp Scanner reports an issue.
 `
metadata:
    language: v2-beta
    name: "Host-level"
    description: "Checks for an exposed git directory"
    author: "Carlos Montoya"

run for each:
    potential_path =
        "/.git/config",
        "/.git/config~"

given host then
    send request called check:
        method: "GET"
        path: {potential_path}

    if "[core]" in {check.response.body} then
        report issue:
            severity: info
            confidence: certain
            detail: `Git directory found at {potential_path}.`
            remediation: "Ensure your git directories are not exposed."
    end if
        `

## Step 1: Add metadata
`
metadata:
    language: v2-beta
    name: "Host-level"
    description: "Checks for an exposed git directory"
    author: "Carlos Montoya"
        `

 The definition starts with a `metadata` block. For more information on available metadata properties, see the reference documentation.


## Step 2: Configure potential paths

`
run for each:
    potential_path =
        "/.git/config",
        "/.git/config~"
        `

 The next step is to configure the paths that Burp Scanner should send requests to when trying to locate the `git-config` file.


 The example code declares a variable called `potential_path`, which contains a list of potential locations for the file. Burp Scanner will iterate through this list, performing one full check for each entry before moving on to the next one.


## Step 3: Configure the request
`
given host then
    send request called check:
        method: "GET"
        path: {potential_path}
        `

 The next step is to configure the request that Burp Scanner will send. In this case, Burp Scanner sends a GET request to one of the locations named in the `potential_path` variable.


 Note that this request is named using the `called` keyword. The request name is used in the next step to identify the correct response body.


## Step 4: Report issues
`
if "[core]" in {check.response.body} then
    report issue:
        severity: info
        confidence: certain
        detail: `Git directory found at {potential_path}.`
        remediation: "Ensure your git directories are not exposed."
        `

 The next step is to report issues where appropriate. Burp Scanner uses an `if` statement to look for the string `[core]` in the body of both responses received. This string can be found in all `git-config` files.


 If Burp Scanner finds the `[core]` string on a response, it reports an informational issue with certain confidence.


 If there are more entries in the `potential_path` list that have not been checked, Burp Scanner re-runs the check for the next entry in the list.
