 This BCheck enables Burp Scanner to use Burp Collaborator to check for SSRF.


 The check works by sending a request containing a Burp Collaborator interaction ID in the `Referer` header. Burp Scanner reports an SSRF issue if Burp Collaborator receives any interactions as a result of this request.
 `
metadata:
  language: v2-beta
  name: "Request-level collaborator-based check"
  description: "Blind SSRF with out-of-band detection"
  author: "Carlos Montoya"

given request then
  send request:
    headers:
      "Referer": {generate_collaborator_address()}

    if http interactions then
      report issue:
        severity: high
        confidence: firm
        detail: "This site fetches arbitrary URLs specified in the Referer header."
        remediation: "Ensure that the site does not directly request URLS from the Referer header."
    end if
        `

## Step 1: Add metadata
`
metadata:
  language: v2-beta
  name: "Request-level collaborator-based check"
  description: "Blind SSRF with out-of-band detection"
  author: "Carlos Montoya"
        `

 The definition starts with a `metadata` block. For more information on available metadata properties, see the reference documentation.


## Step 2: Configure the request
`
given request then
  send request:
    headers:
      "Referer": {generate_collaborator_address()}
        `

 The next step is to configure the request that Burp Scanner sends.


 The example code means that for each request Burp Scanner audits it sends a second request containing a Burp Collaborator interaction ID in the `Referer` header. The `{generate_collaborator_address()}` reserved variable causes Burp Collaborator to generate and insert a new interaction ID into the request.


## Step 3: Analyze the results
`
if http interactions then
  report issue:
    severity: high
    confidence: firm
    detail: "This site fetches arbitrary URLs specified in the Referer header."
    remediation: "Ensure that the site does not directly request URLS from the Referer header."
end if
        `

 The final step in the check is to see whether Burp Collaborator has received any interactions as a result of the request.


 This `if` statement uses the `http interactions` conditional. If the request results in the Collaborator server receiving a HTTP interaction, then the condition is true and Burp Scanner raises an issue with `high` severity and a confidence level of `firm`.


## Test this BCheck

 You can test out this BCheck on the [Blind SSRF with out-of-band detection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind/lab-out-of-band-detection) Web Security Academy lab. The check solves the lab outright.
