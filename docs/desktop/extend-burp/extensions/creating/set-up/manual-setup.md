 You can set up your extension development environment to suit your preferences. This page covers the setup requirements and steps.

#### Note

 If you want a faster setup, try our starter project. The project provides a ready-to-use template, so you can skip these steps and start coding immediately. For more information, see [Setting up your extension development environment using the starter project](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/extensions/creating/set-up/starter-project).


## Prerequisites

 Before you begin:

- Download a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE provides features like auto-completion and syntax highlighting to help streamline development. We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Community Edition), a free Java IDE.
-
 To use an LLM to help you write your extension, install or access your preferred model. This tutorial uses Claude Code, as we provide a
 `CLAUDE.md` file designed specifically for it. You can easily adapt the instructions for use with other LLMs. For more information on Claude Code, see the
 [Anthropic documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code).


## Step 1: Create a new project

 Set up a new project in your IDE with the following details:

-

**Project type:** Select Gradle or Maven. These build systems manage dependencies, simplifying project setup. If your IDE doesn't let you create a Maven or Gradle project directly, create a Java project and configure it to use Maven or Gradle as the build system.
-

**Language:** Java.
-

**Gradle DSL**: If you're prompted to choose a Gradle DSL, you can select either Groovy or Kotlin. This only impacts how you configure Gradle - not your Java extension code.
-

**Java version**: Use version 21. Depending on your IDE, this configuration option may be labeled as something like
 **JDK**, **SDK** or **JRE**. Burp only supports extensions written in Java 21 or lower.

## Step 2: Add the Montoya API dependency

 Once your project is set up, add the Montoya API to your project's dependencies.

### Gradle configuration

 To add the Montoya API in a Gradle project:

1.

Go to the Gradle build file.
1.

Add the following inside the `dependencies` section:

  -

For a Gradle DSL `build.gradle` file: `compileOnly "net.portswigger.burp.extensions:montoya-api:LATEST-VERSION"`
  -

For a Kotlin DSL `build.gradle.kts` file: `compileOnly("net.portswigger.burp.extensions:montoya-api:LATEST-VERSION")`

1.
 Update `LATEST-VERSION` with the latest Montoya API version number, available from the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/PortSwigger/burp-extensions-montoya-api/releases).

1.

Sync the Gradle changes.

### Maven configuration

To add the Montoya API in a Maven project:

1.

Go to the `pom.xml` file.
1.

Add the following inside the `dependency` block: `<dependency>
        <groupId>net.portswigger.burp.extensions</groupId>
        <artifactId>montoya-api</artifactId>
        <version>LATEST-VERSION</version>
</dependency>`
1.
 Update `LATEST-VERSION` with the latest Montoya API version number, available from the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/PortSwigger/burp-extensions-montoya-api/releases).

1.

Update your Maven dependencies.

## Step 3: Create your extension class

 Create a Java class. This file will contain your extension code.

 To create a new class file in your IDE:

1.

Right-click the folder where you want to keep your code, typically `src > main > java`.
1.

Select the option to create a new Java class. Depending on your IDE, this may be labeled as **New > Java class** or similar.
1.

Enter a name for the class. For example, `Extension`.

## Step 4: Confirm correct setup

 To check that the project is correctly configured, attempt to build a JAR file. If the build is successful, you're ready to start writing.

 For instructions, see [Building a JAR file](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/extensions/creating/loading-in-burp#step-1-build-the-jar-file).

## [Optional] Step 5: Enable LLM support

 You can use an LLM to help you write your extension. To support this, we provide a `CLAUDE.md` file that includes essential context for the model. You can use this file with Claude Code or any other LLM.

#### Note

 Make sure to review and test any code suggested by your LLM, as it may not always produce correct or secure output.


### Claude Code support

 To use Claude Code to help you write your extension:

1.

Download our [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/PortSwigger/extension-template-project/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) file and
 [supporting documentation](https://github.com/PortSwigger/extension-template-project/tree/main/docs) from GitHub.
1.

Add the `CLAUDE.md` file to the root of your extension project folder.
1.

Create a `docs` folder in your extension project and add the supporting documentation inside it.
1.

Open a terminal and navigate to your extension project folder.
1.

Run Claude Code using the following command: `claude`.
1.

Prompt Claude to create some code for your extension.

 Claude should automatically read the contents of the `ExtensionTemplateProject` folder, including the `CLAUDE.md` file, then create draft code for you to review. If you think it hasn't read the `CLAUDE.md` file, directly prompt it to do so before continuing.

### Other LLM support

 To use an LLM other than Claude Code to help you write your extension, directly prompt the LLM to read the `CLAUDE.md` file and supporting documentation in the `docs` folder, or provide their contents as part of your context window.

## Next steps

 You're ready to start writing your extension. For a tutorial, see [Writing your first extension](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/extensions/creating/first-extension).
