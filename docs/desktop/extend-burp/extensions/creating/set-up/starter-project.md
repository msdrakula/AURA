# Setting up your extension development environment using the starter project

 The starter project simplifies extension development using the Montoya API. Instead of setting up your development environment manually, you can download the ready-to-use template, open it in an IDE, and start coding immediately.

## Prerequisites

 Before you begin:

-
 Download a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE provides features like auto-completion and syntax highlighting to help streamline development. We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Community Edition), a free Java IDE.

-
 To use an LLM to help you write your extension, install or access your preferred model. This tutorial uses Claude Code, as the starter project includes a
 `CLAUDE.md` file designed specifically for it. You can easily adapt the instructions for use with other LLMs. For more information on Claude Code, see the
 [Anthropic documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code).


## Step 1: Download the template

 To download the starter project:

1.

In Burp, go to **Extensions > APIs**.
1.

Click **Download starter project**.
1.

Choose a location, then click **Save**.

 The project is saved in a folder called `ExtensionTemplateProject`.

## Step 2: Open the project

To open the project:

1.

Open or import the `ExtensionTemplateProject` folder that you just saved in your IDE.
1.

If prompted, follow any set up instructions. This may not be necessary as many IDEs automatically detect Gradle and configure the project.
1.

Set the project Java version to 21. Depending on your IDE, this configuration option may be labeled as something like
 **JDK**, **SDK** or **JRE**. Burp only supports extensions written in Java 21 or lower.

## [Optional] Step 3: Rename the project

 To rename the project:

1.

Open `settings.gradle.kts`.
1.

Change `rootProject.name = "extension-template-project"` to your preferred name.
1.

Sync the Gradle changes.

## [Optional] Step 4: Confirm correct setup

 To check that the project is correctly configured, attempt to build a JAR file. If the build is successful, you're ready to start coding.

 For instructions, see [Building a JAR file](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/extensions/creating/loading-in-burp#step-1-build-the-jar-file).

##
 [Optional] Step 5: Enable LLM support

 You can use an LLM to help you write your extension. To support this, the starter project includes a `CLAUDE.md` file that provides essential context for the model.

 To use this file with an LLM other than Claude Code, prompt the LLM to read the file and supporting documentation in the `docs` folder, or provide their contents as part of your context window.

 To use the `CLAUDE.md` file with Claude Code:

1.

 Open a terminal and navigate to the `ExtensionTemplateProject` folder.

1.

 Run Claude Code using the following command: `claude`
1.

 Prompt Claude to create some code for your extension.


 Claude should automatically read the contents of the `ExtensionTemplateProject` folder, including the `CLAUDE.md` file, then create draft code for you to review. If it doesn't, directly prompt it to read the file before continuing.

#### Note

 Make sure to review and test any code suggested by the LLM, as it may not always produce correct or secure output.


## Next steps

 You're ready to start writing your extension. For a tutorial, see [Writing your first extension](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/extensions/creating/first-extension).

## Understanding the starter project

 The project includes configuration and source files to help with extension development. The key file is `Extension.java`, where you implement your extension's functionality. This section breaks down its key components.
`import burp.api.montoya.BurpExtension;
import burp.api.montoya.MontoyaApi;

public class Extension implements BurpExtension
{
    @Override
    public void initialize(MontoyaApi montoyaApi) {
        montoyaApi.extension().setName("My Extension");
        // Add your code here
    }
}`

The file contains the following essential components:

### Imports
`import burp.api.montoya.BurpExtension;
import burp.api.montoya.MontoyaApi;
`

 These imports bring in two classes from the Montoya API, enabling your extension to communicate with Burp:

-

`BurpExtension` - Allows Burp to recognize your extension.
-

`MontoyaApi` - Gives access to Burp's features.

### Main class
`public class Extension implements BurpExtension
`

 This defines the `Extension` class. It implements `BurpExtension`, which tells Burp this file contains an extension that it should load.

### Initialize method
`@Override
public void initialize(MontoyaApi montoyaApi) {
    montoyaApi.extension().setName("My Extension");

    // Add your code here
}
`

 This method runs when Burp loads your extension. The `montoyaApi` argument provides access to Burp's functionality.

The line `setName("My Extension")` sets the name of your extension, as it appears in Burp's **Extensions > Installed** tab.

The `@Override` annotation ensures that `initialize` correctly implements the `BurpExtension` interface. This means that if you accidentally use an incorrect method name or argument, Java gives an error instead of failing silently.
