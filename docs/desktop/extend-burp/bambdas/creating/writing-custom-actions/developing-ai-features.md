 Learn how to add AI-powered features to your custom actions using the Montoya API. For example, you could use AI to build custom actions that:

-

Analyze requests or responses for vulnerabilities automatically.
-

Generate payloads based on context.
-

Transform or optimize data.

## Sending prompts and handling responses

 The `Prompt` interface sends structured prompts to the AI. A prompt consists of one or more `Message` objects. These can have two types:

-

**System messages**: Set the AI's behavior or role.
-

**User messages**: Represent request or response data, or user queries.

#### Note

It's good practice to start every session or interaction with a system message to define the AI's role and behavior. This helps the AI provide responses aligned with your specific use case.

 To construct a prompt for a custom action:

1.

Get the request or response data that you want to analyze. For more information, see [Accessing request and response data](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/bambdas/creating/writing-custom-actions/writing-guide#step-1-accessing-request-and-response-data).
1.

Construct a system message that defines the AI's role.
1.

Create a user message with the data to analyze, such as request or response data.
1.

Send the prompt to the AI for processing using `ai().prompt().execute`. This returns a `PromptResponse` object.
1.

Retrieve the AI's response as a string using the `content()` method.
1.

Output or use the result.

 The below example shows how to construct a single-shot prompt. It starts with user-selected text and generates output vector variants:
`// Capture the user's selected request text as a string
var selectedText = selection.requestSelection().contents().toString();
if (selectedText.isEmpty()) {
    return;
}
// Define the AI's role with a system message
var systemMessage = "You are a web security expert. Be creative. Just output vectors separated by new lines.  Do not output markdown. Do not prefix with a number. Do not quote with backticks. Work out what is being tested then create 10 variants separated by new lines. The variants you create should be useful for bypassing a WAF for security testing purposes. Create 10 variants of this:";
// Send the system message and the user message with the user's selected text, then retrieve the AI's response content
var aiOutput = ai().prompt().execute(Message.systemMessage(systemMessage), Message.userMessage(selectedText)).content();
// Log the response
logging.logToOutput(aiOutput);
`

## Setting the temperature

 Temperature is a numeric value between `0` and `2`. This setting controls the balance between predictable and creative responses, enabling you to tailor the AI's behavior to your specific needs:

-

Lower temperatures (`0.0 - 0.8`) produce more predictable and deterministic outputs. They are best used for technical or factual tasks.
-

Higher temperatures (`0.8 - 2.0`) produce more creative and diverse outputs. They are suitable for exploratory tasks.

 As a general rule, lower temperatures produce better results for security-related applications. By default, the temperature is set to `0.5`.

 The below example shows how to set the temperature:
`// Capture the user's selected request text as a string
var selectedText = selection.requestSelection().contents().toString();
if (selectedText.isEmpty()) {
    return
}
// Set the temperature
var temperature = 1.0;
// Create a prompt for the user message, using the user's selected content
var prompt = "Guess possible meanings of this web identifier, concisely: " + selectedText;
// Send the user message with the defined temperature, then retrieve the AI's response content
var aiOutput = api.ai().prompt().execute(PromptOptions.promptOptions().withTemperature(temperature), Message.userMessage(prompt)).content();
// Log the response
logging.logToOutput(aiOutput);
`

## Handling exceptions

 Because users receive immediate feedback on errors in the **Output** panel, you often don't need to handle exceptions in custom actions.

 However if you'd like to handle errors more cleanly, you can wrap calls to AI methods, like `ai().prompt().execute()`, in a `try-catch` block. When an error is thrown, a `PromptException` is thrown, which contains an error message that you can retrieve using `getMessage()`.

 The following example shows how to catch and handle errors when sending a single-shot prompt:
`try {
// Capture the request body as a string
var requestBody = requestResponse.request().toString();
// Define the AI's role with a system prompt
var systemMessage = "You are a web security expert. Analyze the request and identify anything that may indicate a vulnerability.";
// Send the system message and user message with the request body, then retrieve the AI's response content
var aiOutput = ai().prompt().execute(Message.systemMessage(systemMessage), Message.userMessage(requestBody)).content();
// Log the response
logging.logToOutput(aiOutput);
} catch (PromptException e) {
// Log any errors
logging.logToError("An error occurred while processing the prompt: " + e.getMessage());
}
`
