 The Montoya API enables you to integrate AI-powered functionality into your custom actions. Follow these best practices to ensure your custom action is secure, efficient, and produces high-quality results.

#### Note

 For examples of AI-powered custom actions that have been created by our research team and the community, see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PortSwigger/bambdas/tree/main/CustomAction).


 To learn how to add AI-powered features to your custom actions, see [Developing AI features in custom actions](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/bambdas/creating/writing-custom-actions/developing-ai-features).

## Mitigate prompt injection attacks

 Treat raw output from AI models as untrusted. Escape any AI-generated content before presenting it to users. Make sure that you use proper HTML encoding to neutralize potential threats.

## Optimize AI requests for efficiency and security

 To ensure AI interactions are efficient, secure, and cost-effective, it's important to control what data is sent, how it's formatted, and when requests are made.

 To optimize requests effectively:

-

Only send essential data. For example, avoid including full HTTP requests if only specific headers or parameters are needed, and only send traffic that is in-scope for the application you are testing.
-

Where possible, strip out sensitive data such as authentication tokens or session cookies.
-

Use structured data formats like JSON instead of free-text input to prevent prompt injection. Structured formats enforce a strict schema, making it harder for attackers to manipulate AI prompts. Since JSON strings are automatically escaped, they prevent unintended input injection.
-

Validate and encode outgoing data before sending it, to prevent prompt injection or unintended execution.

## Use effective prompts

 A well-structured prompt helps the AI to provide relevant and high-quality responses. We recommend that you:

-

Define the AI's role using a system message. This helps set the context and behavior for the AI throughout the conversation.
-

Provide relevant background information in the user prompt.
-

Clearly specify what you want the AI to do.

## Use lower temperatures for better accuracy

 The temperature setting controls the balance between predictability and creativity in AI responses:

-

Lower temperatures (0.0 - 0.8) produce more predictable and accurate outputs. They are best used for technical or factual tasks.
-

Higher temperatures (0.8 - 2.0) produce more creative and diverse outputs. They may cause the AI to produce inconsistent results, potentially making security-related responses unreliable. They are suitable for exploratory tasks.

 The default temperature is `0.5`.
