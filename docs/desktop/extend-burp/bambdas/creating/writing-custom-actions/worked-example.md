 Custom actions are scripts that run directly in Burp Repeater to automate tasks and extract information during manual testing.

 In the worked example below, we'll use Java to write a custom action that extracts a CSRF token from the response body, modifies it, then logs the modified CSRF token.

 In this example, our custom action script is:
`var resp = requestResponse.response().bodyToString();
if (resp.contains("csrf=")){
	var csrfIndex = resp.lastIndexOf("csrf=")+5;
	var csrf = resp.substring(csrfIndex, csrfIndex+16);
	csrf = csrf.replace("a", "b").replace("c", "d");
	logging.logToOutput(csrf);
}
else{
	logging.logToOutput("No CSRF token");
}
`

## Step 1: Get the response body
`var response = requestResponse.response().bodyToString();`

 This retrieves the body of the HTTP response and stores it as a string in the `response` variable.

 Breakdown of the code:

-

`requestResponse` represents the request/response pair the action is applied to.
-

`response().bodyToString()` gets the response object and converts the body to a string.

## Step 2: Check the response body for the CSRF token
`if (response.contains("csrf=")) {`

 This checks whether the response body object contains the string `csrf=`. If the string is found, the statement returns true.

## Step 3: Extract and process the token
`var csrfIndex = response.lastIndexOf("csrf=") + 5;
var csrf = response.substring(csrfIndex, csrfIndex + 16);
csrf = csrf.replace("a", "b").replace("c", "d");`

 This runs if the response body contains the string `csrf=`. It finds the last occurrence of `csrf=`, extracts the 16-character token that follows, and modifies it by replacing certain characters.

 Breakdown of the code:

-

`lastIndexOf("csrf=")` returns the index of the last occurrence of `csrf=` in the response.
-

`+5` moves the index to the start of the actual token, just after `csrf=`.
-

`response.substring(csrfIndex, csrfIndex + 16)` extracts the 16 characters of the token from the response, starting at `csrfIndex` and ending at `csrfIndex + 16`.
-

`replace("a", "b").replace("c", "d")` replaces characters `a` with `b`, and `c` with `d` in the extracted CSRF token.

## Step 4: Log the result
`logging.logToOutput(csrf);`

 This logs the modified CSRF token to the **Output** panel in the  **Custom actions** side panel.

## Step 5: Handle the situation where no token is found
`else{
	logging.logToOutput("No CSRF token");
}`

 If the `csrf=` string isn't found in Step 2, this logs the message `No CSRF token`.
