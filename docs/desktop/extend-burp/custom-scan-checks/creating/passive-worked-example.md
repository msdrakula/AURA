# Passive scan check worked example

 You can extend Burp Scanner by writing your own scan checks. A custom scan check can report new security issues that Burp doesn't detect natively.

 In this worked example, we'll use Java to write a passive custom scan check. Passive checks analyze traffic without modifying or sending any new requests. Use these to detect vulnerabilities that are visible directly in responses, such as:

-

Missing security headers.
-

Leaked server information in error messages.
-

Insecure cookies or forms configurations.

 This example reports an issue when a response doesn't include a `Content-Security-Policy` header. It is intended to run once for every request in the scan:
`if (!requestResponse.hasResponse()) {
    return AuditResult.auditResult();
}

if (!requestResponse.response().hasHeader("Content-Security-Policy")) {
    var issueTitle = "Content Security Policy header missing";
    var issueDetail = "The response does not include a Content-Security-Policy header. Without this header the browser cannot enforce a restrictive policy for scripts, styles, images and other resources, increasing exposure to XSS, click-jacking and content-injection attacks.";
    var remediation = "Add a suitable Content-Security-Policy header, for example: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';";
    var background = "Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP response header that tells the browser which sources are permitted for each resource type. A correctly configured CSP helps mitigate XSS and other code-injection flaws by limiting the origins from which content can be loaded.";
    var remediationBackground = "Create a baseline policy in report-only mode, review violation reports, then switch to enforcement. Start with default-src 'self' and add only the sources that the application legitimately requires.";

    return AuditResult.auditResult(
        AuditIssue.auditIssue(
            issueTitle,
            issueDetail,
            remediation,
            requestResponse.request().url(),
            AuditIssueSeverity.LOW,
            AuditIssueConfidence.FIRM,
            background,
            remediationBackground,
            AuditIssueSeverity.LOW,
            requestResponse
        )
    );
}

return AuditResult.auditResult();`

## Step 1: Make sure there's a response
`if (!requestResponse.hasResponse())
{
    return AuditResult.auditResult();
}`

 Before doing anything, the check confirms there's a response to work with. It exits cleanly if a response doesn't exist.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`requestResponse` represents the request/response pair that Burp passes to your script.
-

`hasResponse` checks if a response was received.
-

If no response is received, `AuditResult.auditResult()` returns an empty result, meaning that no issue is reported.

## Step 2: Check for the CSP header
`if (!requestResponse.response().hasHeader("Content-Security-Policy")) {
    // Build and return an issue
}`

 This checks if the response sets a `Content-Security-Policy` header. If the header is missing, the code will continue to build an issue.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`requestResponse.response()` gets the HTTP response object.
-

`hasHeader` looks for a specific header in a case-insensitive way.

## Step 3: Build the issue variables
`var issueTitle = "Content Security Policy header missing";
var issueDetail = "The response does not include a Content-Security-Policy header. Without this header the browser cannot enforce a restrictive policy for scripts, styles, images and other resources, increasing exposure to XSS, click-jacking and content-injection attacks.";
var remediation = "Add a suitable Content-Security-Policy header, for example: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';";
var background = "Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP response header that tells the browser which sources are permitted for each resource type. A correctly configured CSP helps mitigate XSS and other code-injection flaws by limiting the origins from which content can be loaded.";
var remediationBackground = "Create a baseline policy in report-only mode, review violation reports, then switch to enforcement. Start with default-src 'self' and add only the sources that the application legitimately requires."`

 These variables define what appears in the reported issue.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`issueTitle` is the issue name.
-

`issueDetail` explains the risk and impact of a missing CSP.
-

`remediation` gives a safe baseline header example.
-

`background` adds context about this security mechanism.
-

`remediationBackground` adds guidance for rolling out a CSP safely.

## Step 4: Return an issue if no CSP header is present
`return AuditResult.auditResult(
    AuditIssue.auditIssue(
        issueTitle,
        issueDetail,
        remediation,
        requestResponse.request().url(),
        AuditIssueSeverity.LOW,
        AuditIssueConfidence.FIRM,
        background,
        remediationBackground,
        AuditIssueSeverity.LOW,
        requestResponse
    )
);
`

 This wraps the issue variables into an `AuditIssue` and returns an `AuditResult` containing that issue. When the check reports a finding, users can view it in the **All issues** panel (accessible from the bottom dock) or from the **Issues** tab for the relevant task on the **Dashboard**.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`request().url()` links the issue to the base URL where it was identified.
-

`AuditIssueSeverity.LOW` sets the severity of the finding.
-

`AuditIssueConfidence.FIRM` indicates a high level of confidence in the result.
-

`requestResponse` provides Burp with the request and response to display.

## Step 5: Return an empty result when the header is present
`return AuditResult.auditResult();`

 If the `Content-Security-Policy` header exists, or the script exited early in Step 1, this returns an empty result so no issue is reported.
