 You can extend Burp Scanner by writing your own scan checks. A custom scan check can report new security issues that Burp doesn't detect natively.

 In this worked example, we'll use Java to write an active custom scan check. Active checks send additional, modified requests to probe for vulnerabilities. Use these to detect issues that only appear when requests are manipulated, such as:

-

SQL injection.
-

Server-side template injection.
-

Command injection.

 This example sends two follow-up requests with a forged `Origin` header. It reports an issue if the server reflects the header in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. The issue severity is raised if `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` is also present, and a note is created if `Vary: Origin` is missing:
`if (!requestResponse.hasResponse())
{
    return AuditResult.auditResult();
}

var evilHttps = "https://"
    + api().utilities().randomUtils().randomString(6) + "."
    + api().utilities().randomUtils().randomString(3);
var evilHttp = "http://"
    + api().utilities().randomUtils().randomString(6) + "."
    + api().utilities().randomUtils().randomString(3);

for (var origin : new String[]{evilHttps, evilHttp}) {
    var rr = http.sendRequest(
        requestResponse.request()
            .withRemovedHeader("Origin")
            .withAddedHeader("Origin", origin)
    );

    if (!rr.hasResponse())
    {
        continue;
    }

    var headers = rr.response().headers().toString().toLowerCase();
    var creds = headers.contains("access-control-allow-credentials: true");
    var reflect = headers.contains("access-control-allow-origin: " + origin.toLowerCase());
    var vary = headers.contains("vary: origin");

    if (reflect) {
        var severity = creds ? AuditIssueSeverity.HIGH : AuditIssueSeverity.MEDIUM;
        var note = vary ? "" : " (missing Vary: Origin)";
        return AuditResult.auditResult(
            AuditIssue.auditIssue(
                "CORS: arbitrary origin reflection" + note,
                "Reflected Origin: " + origin + "; credentials=" + creds,
                "Use strict allowlist; include Vary: Origin.",
                rr.request().url(),
                severity,
                AuditIssueConfidence.FIRM,
                "",
                "",
                severity,
                rr
            )
        );
    }
}

return AuditResult.auditResult();`

## Step 1: Make sure there's a response
`if (!requestResponse.hasResponse())
{
    return AuditResult.auditResult();
}`

 Before doing anything, the check confirms there's a response to work with. It exits cleanly if a response doesn't exist.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`requestResponse` represents the request/response pair that Burp passes to your script.
-

`hasResponse` checks whether a response was received.
-

If no response is received, `AuditResult.auditResult()` returns an empty result, and no issue is reported.

## Step 2: Create random origins
`var evilHttps = "https://"
    + api().utilities().randomUtils().randomString(6) + "."
    + api().utilities().randomUtils().randomString(3);
var evilHttp = "http://"
    + api().utilities().randomUtils().randomString(6) + "."
    + api().utilities().randomUtils().randomString(3);`

 This creates two random domains to avoid caching artifacts and ensure the application can't allowlist them.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`randomUtils().randomString(n)` creates short random labels, such as `q1w2e3`.
-

Both `https` and `http` will be tested, as some servers handle them differently.

## Step 3: Loop through each origin
`for (var origin : new String[]{evilHttps, evilHttp})`

 This runs the following block of code twice, once for each randomly generated origin.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`new String[]{evilHttps, evilHttp}` creates a new array containing the two fake origins.
-

`for (var origin : ...)` is a for-each loop that assigns each origin in turn.

## Step 4: Send the modified requests
`var rr = http.sendRequest(
    requestResponse.request()
        .withRemovedHeader("Origin")
        .withAddedHeader("Origin", origin)
);`

 This sends the request twice, each time with a forged `Origin` header. If the server doesn't respond, the loop continues to the next origin.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`requestResponse.request()` gets the HTTP request object.
-

`withRemovedHeader("Origin")` removes the original `Origin` header.
-

`withAddedHeader("Origin", origin)` appends the `Origin` header with the fake value to the request.
-

`http.sendRequest(...)` sends the modified request and returns a new request-response object (`rr`).
-

`if (!rr.hasResponse())` checks to see if the server replied.
-

`continue` skips the rest of the loop and proceeds to the next origin if there was no response.

## Step 5: Inspect the response headers
`var headers = rr.response().headers().toString().toLowerCase();
var creds = headers.contains("access-control-allow-credentials: true");
var reflect = headers.contains("access-control-allow-origin: " + origin.toLowerCase());
var vary = headers.contains("vary: origin");`

 This examines the response headers to see how the server handled the forged `Origin` header.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`rr.response().headers` retrieves all response headers.
-

`toString().toLowerCase()` converts the headers into a single lowercase string, so you can search case-insensitively.
-

`reflect` is true if the server repeats the forged origin in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
-

`creds` is true if the response also includes `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.
-

`vary` is true if the response includes `Vary: Origin`.

## Step 6: Return an issue if the origin is reflected
`if (reflect) {
    var severity = creds ? AuditIssueSeverity.HIGH : AuditIssueSeverity.MEDIUM;
    var note     = vary ? "" : " (missing Vary: Origin)";
    return AuditResult.auditResult(
        AuditIssue.auditIssue(
            "CORS: arbitrary origin reflection" + note,
            "Reflected Origin: " + origin + "; credentials=" + creds,
            "Use strict allowlist; include Vary: Origin.",
            rr.request().url(),
            severity,
            AuditIssueConfidence.FIRM,
            "",
            "",
            severity,
            rr
        )
    );
}`

 This creates variables that determine the severity of the finding based on whether the server allows credentials, and adds a note if the `Vary: Origin` header is missing. It then wraps the issue variables into an `AuditIssue` and returns an `AuditResult` containing that issue.

### Breakdown of the code

-

`if (reflect)` checks whether the server reflected the random origin in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
-

`creds ? AuditIssueSeverity.HIGH : AuditIssueSeverity.MEDIUM` sets the severity to `HIGH` if credentials are allowed, otherwise `MEDIUM`.
-

`var note = vary ? "" : " (missing Vary: Origin)"` adds a warning note when the `Vary: Origin` header is absent.
-

`AuditIssue.auditIssue(...)` builds the vulnerability report. For a breakdown of the elements that make up an `auditIssue`, see [Reporting results](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/custom-scan-checks/creating/writing-guide#reporting-results).

## Step 7: Return no issue when the header is present
`return AuditResult.auditResult();`

 If the check didn't detect a reflection or exited early in Step 1, it returns an empty result so no issue is reported.
