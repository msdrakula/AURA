# Modifying HTTP requests with Burp Proxy

**Read time: ** 3 Minutes

 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to modify intercepted requests in Burp Proxy. This enables you to manipulate these requests in ways that the website isn't expecting, in order to see how it responds.
 Using one of our deliberately vulnerable websites, known as "labs", you'll see how this can help you identify and exploit real vulnerabilities.


#### Web Security Academy

 To follow along, you'll need an account on `portswigger.net`. If you don't have one already, [registration is free](https://portswigger.net/users/register) and it grants you full access to the Web Security Academy.


## Step 1: Access the vulnerable website in Burp's browser

 In Burp, go to the **Proxy > Intercept** tab and make sure [interception is switched off](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/intercept-messages#controls).


 Launch Burp's browser and use it to visit the following URL:
  `https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-excessive-trust-in-client-side-controls`

 When the page loads, click **Access the lab**. If prompted, log in to your portswigger.net account. After a few seconds, you will see your own instance of a fake shopping website.

## Step 2: Log in to your shopping account

 On the shopping website, click **My account** and log in using the following credentials:


**Username: **`wiener`

**Password: **`peter`

 Notice that you have just $100 of store credit.


## Step 3: Find something to buy

 Click **Home** to go back to the home page. Select the option to view the product details for the **Lightweight "l33t" leather jacket**.


## Step 4: Study the add to cart function

 In Burp, go to the **Proxy > Intercept** tab and switch interception on. In the browser, add the leather jacket to your cart to intercept the resulting
 `POST /cart` request.

#### Note

 You may see more than one request on the **Proxy > Intercept** tab if the browser is doing something else in the background. In this case, select the `POST /cart` request.


 Study the intercepted request and notice that there is a parameter in the body called `price`, which matches the price of the item in cents.


## Step 5: Modify the request

 Change the value of the `price` parameter to 1 and click **Forward > Forward all** to send the modified request to the server, along with any other intercepted requests.

 Switch interception off again so that any subsequent requests can pass through Burp Proxy uninterrupted.


## Step 6: Exploit the vulnerability

 In Burp's browser, click the basket icon in the upper-right corner to view your cart. Notice that the jacket has been added for just one cent.


#### Note

 There is no way to modify the price via the web interface. You were only able to make this change thanks to Burp Proxy.


 Click the **Place order** button to purchase the jacket for an extremely reasonable price.

 Congratulations, you've also just solved your first Web Security Academy lab! You've also learned how to intercept, review, and manipulate HTTP traffic using Burp Proxy.
