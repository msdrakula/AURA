 By default, as you use Burp's browser, Burp logs all HTTP or WebSocket messages for further analysis. By setting a scope, you can tell Burp which URLs you want to test and which you don't want to test. For example, you may want to exclude URLs that:


- You don't have permission to test.
- Aren't safe to test. For example, URLs that contain potentially dangerous functionality.
- Aren't relevant. Once you have set the scope, you can use the filters in the Target site map and Proxy history to screen out some of the noise.

#### Note

 In Burp Suite Community Edition, your scope settings are lost when you close Burp, along with any other data. You can save the scope settings as part of a project file in Burp Suite Professional. For more information, see
 [Project files](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/projects).


## Adding URLs to the scope

 To add a URL to your scope:


1. Click  **Scope settings** on the lower toolbar to open the **Settings** dialog.
1. Scroll to the **Target scope** setting.
1. Under **Include in scope**, click **Add**. The **Add** prefix for in-scope URLs dialog opens.
1. Enter the prefix for the URLs that you want to match, then click **OK**.
1. When prompted, choose whether to stop logging out-of-scope traffic. This can provide performance benefits.

 The prefix is added to the **Include in scope** list. Any URL that starts with this exact prefix is now in scope. Any URL that doesn't start with a prefix from the list is out of scope. For example, if you add
 `https://example.com`, requests to any path on this domain are in scope if they're accessed over HTTPS.


## Excluding URLs from the scope

 After you add a URL to your scope, you may want to exclude specific paths that are a subset of the in-scope prefixes, such as `https://example.com/admin`. To exclude a URL from your scope:


1. Click  **Scope settings** on the lower toolbar to open the **Settings** dialog.
1. Scroll to the **Target scope** setting.
1. Under **Exclude from scope**, click **Add**. The **Add prefix for out-of-scope URLs** dialog opens.
1. Enter a prefix for the URLs that you want to exclude, then click **OK**.

 The prefix is added to the **Exclude from scope** list. A URL is now in scope if it starts with an in-scope prefix, but does not start with an out-of-scope prefix.
