 You can use Burp Repeater to manipulate and resend individual WebSocket messages, and analyze the application's responses.


 To send WebSocket requests with Burp Repeater:


1. Go to **Proxy > WebSockets history**.
1. Right-click on a WebSocket message, and click **Send to Repeater**. A new tab is added to Repeater containing the request.
1. Go to **Repeater** and view the WebSocket message details in the new tab.
1. Modify the message.
1. Select whether the message should be sent to the server or client.
1. Click **Send** to send the message to the target server or client, and view the response.
1. To resend the message, right-click on it and click **Edit and resend**. Do this as many times as you like to see how modifying the message in different ways changes the response.

#### Note

 The option to send a message to the client is only available in connections that are still open via Burp Proxy.


## WebSocket Repeater tab

 For WebSocket messages, each Repeater tab contains the following items:


- A message editor which contains the WebSocket message to be sent. You can use the [message editor](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/message-editor) functions to analyze and edit the message.
-

 The WebSocket connection via which the message is sent. This is set automatically when you send a message to Repeater.


  - To disconnect or reconnect to a WebSocket connection, use the toggle in the WebSocket ID header.
  - To edit a connection click on the edit icon  in the WebSocket ID header. You can clone or attach to any open connection, create a new connection, or reconnect a closed connection. You can then manipulate the negotiation request used to create the WebSocket.

-

 A history table that shows all messages that have been sent and received. Manually generated messages are indicated in the table.


  - To automatically select the next message that is received in the history table, check **Select next message received**.

- A message viewer for the message that is currently selected in the history table.

 You can customize and sort the table contents. For more information, see [Customizing Burp's tables](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/burps-layout/customize-tables).
