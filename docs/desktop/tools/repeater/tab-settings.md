 You can override the global [Repeater settings](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/tools/repeater) selected in the Settings dialog for an individual tab.


 To configure tab-specific settings:


1. Select the tab you want to configure.
1. Click the settings icon  next to the **Send** button to display a context menu containing **Repeater** settings. The available settings are the same as those found in the [**Settings** dialog](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings).
1. Select the required settings from the menu.

 If you select a setting on the tab-specific menu then Repeater ignores all global settings for that tab. Make sure that all settings are configured correctly on the tab-specific menu before you send requests from the tab. For example, if you select **Process cookies in redirections** on the global Repeater menu, and **Enable HTTP/1 connection reuse** on a tab-specific menu, the global **Process cookies in redirections** setting is ignored.


 If you modify settings for a tab, the tab's settings icon turns blue. To return a tab to the global Repeater settings, click its settings icon  next to the **Send** button and select **Restore global default** from the context menu.


 If you use a project file, any tab-specific settings you configure for open tabs are retained when you re-open Burp Suite.
