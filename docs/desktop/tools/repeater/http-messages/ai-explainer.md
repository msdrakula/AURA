 Explainer provides AI-generated explanations for selected sections of HTTP messages in Repeater. This helps you to interpret key details quickly, enabling you to research unfamiliar message components without leaving Burp Suite or disrupting your workflow.


 For example, AI-powered explanations can:


-

Identify the application framework behind a header.
-

Clarify JavaScript functionality that may affect security.
-

Explain obscure headers, cookies, or HTML tags from a security perspective.

#### Note

 AI-powered features require AI credits. To learn more about AI credits, see [AI credits](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/burp-ai/ai-credits).


## Generating an AI-powered explanation

 To generate an AI-powered explanation:


1.

In Repeater, highlight part of an HTTP request or response. The highlighted section must be between 3 and 1000 characters in length.
1.

Right-click and select ** Explain this**, or use the Ctrl+E / Cmd+E hotkey.

 The explanation appears in the **Explanations** panel on the sidebar.


 As with all of Burp's AI-powered features, Explainer requests are processed in real time and not retained by the AI service provider. Burp only sends the part of the message you highlight to the AI.


#### Tip

 For best results, focus on a single feature, such as a header, parameter, or JavaScript function.


## Managing explanations

 The **Explanations** panel only appears when you request an explanation. From here, you can:


-

**Expand or collapse explanations** - Click  or .
-

**Regenerate an explanation** - Click  to request a new AI response.
-

**Delete an explanation** - Right-click the explanation header and select  Delete.
