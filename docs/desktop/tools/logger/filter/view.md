You can use the view filter to control which captured items Burp Logger displays.
 For more information on which items Logger captures, see [Configuring the Burp Logger capture filter](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/logger/filter/capture).

Items that are not displayed because of view filter settings can be accessed by removing the view filter.

You can configure the Logger view filter in two different ways:

- **[Settings mode](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/logger/filter/view#settings-mode)** - Configure a view filter using checkboxes and drop-downs.
- **[Script mode](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/logger/filter/view#script-mode)** - Apply a powerful custom view filter using Burp's Java-based scripts.

To filter which of the captured items are displayed, click on the **View filter** bar. This opens the **Logger view filter** window.

The **View filter** bar only appears when there is one or more items recorded in Logger.

## Settings mode

On the **Settings mode** tab, you can apply a view filter using the following options:

### Filter by request type

Choose which request types Logger displays. You can select from:

- **Show only in-scope items**. For more information on how to set your scope, see [Target scope](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/target/scope).
- **Hide items without responses**.
- **Show only parameterized requests**.

### Filter by MIME type

Choose which MIME type Logger displays, such as HTML or XML.

### Filter by status code

Choose which status codes Logger displays.

### Filter by tool

Choose which Burp tools Logger displays items from. This enables you to ignore traffic from a noisy tool, or direct Logger to display traffic from one tool only.
 By default, all tools are selected.

### Filter by search term

Professional

Choose to display only records that contain a specific search term:

- **Regex**. Specify whether the search term is a literal string or a regular expression.
- **Case sensitive**. Specify whether the search term is case-sensitive.
- **Negative search**. Display only items that do not match the search term.

### Filter by file extension

Choose which types of file Logger displays, such as PHP or CSS.

### Filter by annotation

Choose whether to show only items that have been annotated, either by a comment or highlight. To learn how to annotate items, see [Working with Burp Logger entries](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/logger/entries).

## Script mode

 On the **Script mode** tab, you can apply Java-based scripts to create custom view filters for Logger. For more information, see
 [Configuring the Logger view filter with scripts](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/logger/filter/view-with-scripts).
