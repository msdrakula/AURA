 You can filter the messages that are shown in various Burp Suite tools. This makes it easier for you to analyze a large number of messages.

 The filter bar above the table describes the current display filter. Click the filter bar to view and edit the filter settings. If the filter has a **Settings mode** and a **Script mode**, make sure that you've selected **Settings mode**. For more information about **Script mode**, see [Bambdas](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/bambdas).

#### Note

 Most filters only control what is displayed. Items hidden by the filter aren't deleted and reappear if you reset the filter. The exception is the Burp Logger capture filter, which controls the messages that are captured in Burp Logger.
