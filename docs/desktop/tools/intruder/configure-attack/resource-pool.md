 A resource pool is a group of tasks that share a quota of resources. Resource pools make it easier for you to:


- Manage and prioritize the usage of system resources, particularly across multiple attacks.
- Test applications that tolerate automated requests at different rates.

## Creating resource pools

New tasks are assigned to a default resource pool. You can create a custom pool at any point before you start the attack. To create a resource pool:

1. Go to **Intruder** and click ** Resource pool**. The **Resource pool** side panel opens.
1. Select **Create new resource pool**.
1. Enter a name for the pool and configure the pool settings.
1. The pool is created when you start the attack.

 If you want to create a new pool after the attack has started, you need to do so in a different task or in Burp's **Settings** dialog under **Project** > **Tasks**. To open the dialog, click
 ** Settings** in the top toolbar.


## Resource pool settings

 Each resource pool can be configured with its own throttling settings:


- **Maximum concurrent requests** - Limit the number of requests that the attack sends simultaneously. This is useful so you don't overload the target server or exceed the configured rate limit.
-

**Delay between requests** - This is in milliseconds. You can choose from three delay types:


  - **Fixed**.
  - **With random variations**.
  - **Increase delay in increments** - This enables you to determine the time taken for a session to expire if no requests are sent.

- **Automatic throttling** - Automatically add a short delay between requests when the server responds with one of the specified codes. You can enable and configure this setting in the default resource pool.

## Moving tasks between resource pools

 To move a task before you start an attack, click ** Resource pool** to open the
 **Resource pool** side panel, then select the pool.


To move a task during an attack, click ** Resource pool** in the results window, then select the pool. This enables you to manage the use of system resources in real time.
