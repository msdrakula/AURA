 Burp Intruder includes a range of built-in payload lists. You can use these to quickly and easily generate payloads for various attacks.


## Using predefined payload lists

 You can use a predefined payload list with any payload type that uses a list of strings:


1. Go to **Intruder**. In the **Payloads** side panel, select an appropriate option from the **Payload type** drop-down menu.
1. Click **Add from list...** in the **Payload configuration** field.
1. Select a list from the drop-down menu. The list displays in the **Payload configuration** field.
1. If the list includes placeholders, set up a rule to process them under **Payload processing**.

#### Note

 You can load your own directory of custom payload lists. Do this in Burp's **Settings** dialog. To open the dialog, click on ** Settings** in the top toolbar. For more information, see
 [Intruder settings](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/tools/intruder#payload-list-location).


## Placeholders

Some of the predefined payload lists include placeholders that you can replace with your own values:
|

**Predefined payload list**  |

**Placeholders used in the list**
|

CGI Scripts
   |

`{file}`, `{domain}`
|

Fuzzing - full  |

`{base}`,
 `{domain}`,
 `foo@{domain}`
|

Fuzzing - JSON_XML injection  |

`{base}`
|

Fuzzing - out of band  |

`{domain}`
|

Fuzzing - path traversal (single file)  |

`{file}`
|

Fuzzing - path traversal  |

`{base}`
|

Fuzzing - quick  |

`{base}`

## Processing placeholders

 Before you run an attack with one of the payload lists above, you need to replace placeholders with actual values. The table below details how each of the placeholders can be used:

|

**Placeholder**  |

**Use**  |

**Example placeholder replacement**
|

`{file}`  |

Specify a filename.

   |

`/etc/passwd`
|

`{base}`   |

Replaces `{base}` with value marked as payload.  |

`1337`
|

`{domain}`  |

Specify a web domain.  |

`COLLAB_ID.oastify.com`
|

`foo@{domain}`  |

Specify a web domain as part of an email address.  |

`example.com`

### Processing a placeholder in your attack

 To add a placeholder to your attack, set up a processing rule:


1. Go to **Intruder**. In the **Payloads** side panel, scroll down to the **Payload processing** field.
1. Click **Add**. A window opens with a drop-down list of processing rules.
1. Select **Match/replace**.
1. In the **Match regex** field, type in the placeholder used in the payload. For example, `\{file\}` or `\{domain\}`.
1. In the **Replace with** field, type the item you want to replace the placeholder with. For example, `application.exe` instead of `\{file\}`, or `portswigger.net` instead of `\{domain\}`.
