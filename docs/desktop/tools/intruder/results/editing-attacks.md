 You can monitor and control the attack while it's running in the results window. You have the following options:


-
 To pause the attack, click .

-
 To resume the attack, click .

-
 To restart the attack, click **Attack**, then select **Repeat** from the drop-down menu. This is especially useful after refining your attack configuration based on the initial results.


 You can adjust most aspects of the attack configuration in the results window side panel, except for elements that are fundamental to the attack structure. This includes:


- The attack type.
- The payload positions.
- The payload type.

 To change these fundamental aspects of the configuration, return to the original **Intruder** tab and start a new attack.


#### Note

 We recommend that you pause attacks before you modify your configuration. Changing the configuration while the attack is running may have unanticipated impacts, as changes will execute as each key is pressed.


 For example, if you are using the **[Numbers](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/configure-attack/payload-types#numbers)** payload type and delete a digit from the **To** field, the attack may abruptly complete because the **To** field now contains a smaller number.
