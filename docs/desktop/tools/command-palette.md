## Command list

 Each command in the palette shows the following:

-

**Hotkey** - If a hotkey is configured for the command, it appears beside the description. For information on adding your own hotkeys, see [Hotkey settings](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/ui/hotkeys).
-

**Label** - The command category (for example, **Burp AI**, **Repeater**, or **Extension**).

 When you open the command palette, recently used commands appear at the top of the list for quicker access.

 The command palette includes a wide range of commands, including the following:

-

**Core commands** - Perform core tasks throughout Burp, such as switching tabs, opening tools, encoding data, and exporting content.
-

Professional **Search** - When you start typing, a search option appears at the bottom of the command list. Select this to run a project-wide search.
-

**Settings** - Find and open Burp's settings.
-

**Extensions** - Find and open extensions in the BApp Store.
-

**Extension-created commands** - Use commands registered by installed extensions. For information on how to add a command and hotkey to your extension, see [Adding a hotkey to your Burp extension](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extend-burp/extensions/creating/tutorials/hotkey).

#### Note

 Some commands are only selectable in certain contexts, for example when a **Repeater** tab is active or you've selected a text editor.
