 You can use the filter to control which messages are shown in Organizer. The same filter applies when you switch between the inbox and collections.


 You can also search the table using the search bar.


#### Note

 The filter only controls which items are displayed. Hidden items are not deleted and reappear when you reset or change the filter.


 Click the filter bar to configure the current display filter. This opens the **Organizer filter** window.
