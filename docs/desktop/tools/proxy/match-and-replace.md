 Match and replace rules enable you to automatically replace parts of HTTP and WebSocket messages as they pass through the proxy. You can configure and enable these in the **Proxy > Match and replace** tab. They can used for a variety of tasks, such as adjusting headers, rewriting content, or modifying authentication tokens automatically in real-time.

 Match and replace rules are listed in the **HTTP match and replace rules** and **WebSocket match and replace rules** tables. Burp executes enabled match and replace rules in turn for each message, making any applicable replacements. To change the order in which rules are applied, reorder them using the **Up** and **Down** buttons.

 To only apply match and replace rules to items that are in the project scope, select **Only apply to in-scope items**. For more information on how to set a scope for your work, see
 [Scope settings - Target scope](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/project/scope#target-scope).

## Adding match and replace rules

 You can configure match and replace rules in two different ways:

- **Settings mode** - Configure match and replace rules using checkboxes and drop-downs. You can use this to create rules for both HTTP and WebSocket messages. For more information, see [Creating match and replace rules](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/match-and-replace/creating).
- Professional** Script mode** - Create powerful match and replace rules using Burp's Java-based scripts. You can use this to create rules for HTTP messages. For more information, see [Creating HTTP match and replace rules with scripts](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/match-and-replace/scripts).

 When adding or editing a HTTP match and replace rule, you can test your rule using the built-in test function. For more information, see
 [Testing HTTP match and replace rules](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/match-and-replace/testing).
