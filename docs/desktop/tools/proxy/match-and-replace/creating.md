 You can configure match and replace rules to automatically replace parts of messages as they pass through the proxy. To create a rule, go to the **Proxy > Match and replace** tab and click **Add**. The
 **Add match/replace rule** window opens, which has two modes:

- **[Settings mode](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/match-and-replace/creating#settings-mode)** - Configure match and replace rules using checkboxes and drop-downs. You can use this to create rules for both HTTP and WebSocket messages.
- **[Script mode](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/match-and-replace/creating#script-mode)** - Create powerful match and replace rules using Java-based scripts. You can use this to create rules for HTTP messages.

## Settings mode

On the **Settings mode** tab, you can add match and replace rules using the configuration options. Each match and replace rule specifies a literal string or regex pattern to match, and a string to replace it with.

 You can use this to create rules for both HTTP and WebSocket messages.

To add a new rule using **Settings mode**:

1. In **Proxy > Match and replace**, click **Add** to open the **Add match/replace rule** dialog.
1. In the **Add match/replace rule** dialog, click the **Settings mode** tab.
1.

Specify the details of the match/replace rule:

  - **Type** - For HTTP requests, specify the type of rule you want to define. For example, **Request header** or **Response body**.
  - **Direction** - For WebSocket messages, specify the direction of the message you want the rule to apply to. Choose from **Client to server**, **Server to client**, or **Both directions**.
  - **Match** - The string or regex pattern you want the rule to match. If you leave this blank for an HTTP rule with the **Request header** or **Response header** type, the replacement string is added as a new header.
  - **Replace** - The string you want the rule to replace. If you leave this blank for an HTTP rule with the **Request header** or **Response header** type, then any header that matches is removed.
  - **Comment** - An optional description of the rule.

1. If you want Burp to treat the match parameter as a regex, select **Regex match**. For more information, see [Using regex syntax](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/match-and-replace/creating#using-regex-syntax).
1. For HTTP messages, you can test the rule using the built-in test function. For more information, see [Testing
 HTTP match and replace rules](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/match-and-replace/testing).
1. Click **OK**.

 The new rule is added to the table and automatically enabled for the current project.

### Using regex syntax

You can use a regex pattern to match the text you want to replace. This enables you to match a variety of text inputs that follow a specific format, such as email addresses or IP addresses. It also enables you to match the underlying structure for content that changes dynamically.

#### Matching multi-line regions

 You can use regex syntax to match multi-line regions of a message body. For example, if a response body contains only:
`Now is the time for all good men
    to come to the aid of the party`

 then using the regex:
`Now.*the`

 will match:
`Now is the time for all good men
    to come to the aid of the`

 If you want to match only within a single line, you can modify the regex to:
`Now[^\n]*the`

 which will match:
`Now is the`

#### Using regex groups in back-references and replacement strings

 In a **Match** expression you can:

- Define groups using parentheses. Burp assigns groups a 1-indexed reference number in order from left to right (with group 0 representing the entire match).
- Back-reference groups. Use a backslash followed by the group's index.

 For example, to match a pair of opening and closing tags with no other tags between, you could use the regex:
`<([^/]\w*)[^>]*>[^>]*?</\1[^>]*>`

 You can reference groups in the replacement string by using a $ followed by the group index. For example, the following replacement string would include the name of the tag that matched the above regex:
`Replaced: $1`

## Script mode

Script mode enables you to apply Java-based scripts to define powerful HTTP match and replace rules. For more information, see [Creating HTTP match and replace rules using scripts](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/proxy/match-and-replace/scripts).
