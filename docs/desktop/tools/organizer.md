 Burp Organizer is a workspace for collecting and managing HTTP messages during application testing.
 It provides a way to store and annotate interesting requests and responses without interrupting your testing workflow.


## Sending messages to Organizer

 You can send HTTP messages to Burp Organizer from other Burp tools by right-clicking one or more selected messages and selecting **Send to Organizer**. Alternatively, you can use the default hotkey
 `Ctrl + O`

 Messages appear in the Organizer inbox as read-only copies of the original request and response, including any notes and highlights.

## Collections

 As your testing progresses, you may want to organize messages into collections. Collections are groups of HTTP messages that you create based on how you want to organize your testing.


 Messages can be moved or copied between collections (including back into the inbox), enabling you to group related messages in a way that works for you. Learn more about [Collections](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/organizer/collections).


## Browsing messages in Organizer

 Organizer displays messages from the selected collection in a table with the following columns:


- **#** - The request index number.
- **Time** - When the request was made.
- **Status** - The [status](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/organizer/annotate#statuses-in-organizer) applied to the message.
- **Tool** - The Burp tool that originally generated the request. This always reflects the request's origin, even if the message is later sent from Burp Logger or from within Organizer.

- **Method** - The HTTP method.
- **Host** - The server hostname.
- **Path** - The URL path.
- **Query** - The URL query string.
- **Param count** - The number of parameters in the request.
- **Status code** - The HTTP status code of the response.
- **Length** - The length of the response in bytes.
- **Notes** - Any [notes](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/organizer/annotate#notes-in-organizer) added to the message.

 Right-click any message in the table to access additional actions, such as adding notes, assigning workflow status, and highlighting messages. For more information, see [Annotating Organizer items](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/organizer/annotate).


 You can filter the table to narrow down which messages are shown. For more information, see [Filtering Burp Organizer](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/organizer/filter).


 You can also sort and customize the table to suit the way you work. For more information, see [Customizing Burp's tables](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/burps-layout/customize-tables).


## Inspecting a message in Organizer

 Select a message to inspect its request and response in the lower pane. Both are shown as read-only snapshots.


 To search within the request or response, use the search bar below the message. For more information, see [Text editor - Quick search](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/message-editor/text-editor#quick-search).


 Use the tabs beside the message to switch between the Inspector and Notes panels.
