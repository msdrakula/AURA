# Getting started with Burp Collaborator

 In this tutorial, you will learn how to manually use Burp Collaborator. You will test whether you can induce a target site to make a request to an arbitrary server that could potentially be controlled by an attacker.


## Step 1: Access the lab

 Open Burp's browser, and use it to access the following URL:
 `
			https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind/lab-out-of-band-detection
		`

 Click **Access the lab** and log in to your PortSwigger account if prompted. This opens your own instance of a deliberately vulnerable shopping website.


## Step 2: Browse the target site

 In the browser, explore the site by clicking on a couple of the product pages.


## Step 3: Send an interesting request to Repeater

 In Burp, go to the **Proxy > HTTP history** tab.


 Right-click a `GET /product?productId=[...]` request and select **Send to Repeater**.

## Step 4: Inject a Collaborator payload into the request

 Go to the **Repeater** tab. Highlight the URL in the `Referer` header, right-click, and select **Insert Collaborator payload**. This replaces the `Referer` URL with a URL that points to the Collaborator server, for example:
 `204119i326shak9tnk6k36z8jlahj74r.oastify.com`

 Send the request.

#### Note

 The Collaborator server domain name may change, as we periodically add new domain names. For more information, see [Generating payloads](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/collaborator#generating-payloads).


## Step 5: Poll for interactions

 Go to the **Collaborator** tab. Collaborator polls for interactions every 60 seconds, so you may see some interactions listed already. If not, click **Poll now**. Interactions received as a result of your Collaborator payloads are displayed. This confirms that the target site made a request to the arbitrary server.

 In this case, you see both HTTP and DNS interactions. Click on an interaction to view more details.


## Summary

 Congratulations, you have now successfully:


- Generated a Collaborator payload.
- Inserted a Collaborator payload in a request.
- Induced the application to send a request to your Collaborator subdomain, and identified this by polling the server for interactions.

 You now know how to use Burp Collaborator to manually generate a proof of concept for invisible vulnerabilities, in this case, blind SSRF.


## What next?

 This tutorial is just an initial proof of concept. To learn how you can exploit this kind of behavior in the wild, check out the [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/), in particular:
