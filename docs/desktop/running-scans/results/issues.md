 Burp enables you to track potential vulnerabilities, whether automatically detected by Burp Scanner or manually detected during your penetration testing workflow.
 All issues are recorded in your project file, along with key information to help you resolve or manually investigate the issue.


 For more information on how to manually create issues in Burp Suite Professional, see [Manually creating issues for reports](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/running-scans/reporting/manual-issues).


 You can choose to view either a task-specific list of issues, which contains issues found by an individual task, or a project-level list containing entries for all issues found across all tasks in your project.


 To view the project-level issues list:


1. Go to the **Dashboard** tab.
1. From the bottom dock, select **All issues**.

 To view a task-specific issues list:


1. Go to the **Dashboard** tab.
1. From the **Tasks** list, select the relevant task.
1. In the main panel, go to the **Issues** tab.

 From here, you can:


- Monitor scan results.
- Review new issues as they are reported.
- Assign confidence and severity levels to issues.
- Report and delete issues.

 Each item in the **Issues** table contains the following details:


- **Time** - The time that the issue was found.
- **Source** - The task that found the issue.
- **Issue type** - The issue type.
- **Host** - The host server for the issue.
- **Path** - Where applicable, the URL path to the issue location.
- **Insertion point** - Where applicable, the type of insertion point used in the request that found the issue.
- **Severity** - High, medium, low, or information.
- **Confidence** - Tentative, firm, or certain.
- **Comment** - Any user-applied comment. Double-click this field to add a comment.

 You can customize and sort the table, and copy column data to your clipboard. For more information, see [Customizing Burp's tables](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/burps-layout/customize-tables).


#### Note

 Each issue is only recorded the first time it is found.


 Burp AT also records the issues it finds here, alongside those from Burp Scanner and your manual testing. For more information, see [Burp AT](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/burp-at).
