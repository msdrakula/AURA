 You can upload an OpenAPI definition, SOAP WSDL, or a Postman Collection to run a specific API scan.

#### Note

 This section explains how to run and configure API-only scans in Burp Suite Professional.


 For information on scanning APIs in Burp Suite DAST, see [Scanning APIs](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-apis).


## Step 1: Configure scan type

 To start an API-only scan:

1.
 Click **New scan** on the Dashboard. The scan launcher opens.

1.
 In the **Scan type** tab, select **API-only scan**.


 Once you have specified scan details, select the **API definition** tab.

## Step 2: Upload API definition

 To begin configuring your scan, upload an OpenAPI definition, SOAP WSDL, or a Postman Collection in the **API definition** tab. You can do this in two ways:

-

By providing a URL for the API definition. To do this, enter the URL in the **Upload from URL** field, then click **Upload**.
-

By uploading a definition file. To do this, drag and drop the API definition file into the **Upload from file** field.

 Burp uploads the definition and analyzes it to identify the API details that will be used in the scan. To review the API endpoints, click **Next**.

#### Note

 Burp Scanner must be able to parse and validate definitions in order to upload them. For a full list of criteria that the definition is validated against, see [Requirements for API scanning - API definition requirements](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/api-scanning-reqs#api-definition-requirements).


## Step 3: Review and configure the API details

 You can view API endpoints, authentication methods, and parameters in tables in the **API details** tab. These are automatically populated from your API definition.

#### Note

 You can customize and sort the API detail tables, and copy column data to your clipboard. For more information, see [Customizing Burp's tables](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/burps-layout/customize-tables).


###
 Viewing and configuring endpoints

 API endpoints are listed in a table in the **API details > Endpoints** tab. The table contains the following columns:

- Checkbox - Marks whether the endpoint is selected for scanning. Burp Scanner only scans selected endpoints.
-

**Method** -

  -

For OpenAPI, the HTTP method used by the endpoint.
  -

For SOAP, the name of the SOAP operation.
  -

For Postman, the name of the request.

- **Content type** - The format of the data that will be sent to the API server.
- **Host** - The protocol and server hostname.
- **URL** - The URL file path and query string.

 By default, all endpoints are selected for scanning. To remove an endpoint from the scan, use the checkbox.

 To permanently delete an endpoint, right-click it and select **Delete**.

 You can filter the table by HTTP method or a specific term:

- To filter by the HTTP method, use the filter buttons.
- To filter by a specific term, click  **Search**, then enter your search term.

 Once you've filtered the table, you can deselect or select all filtered endpoints as a bulk action, using the top checkbox.

#### Note

 Endpoints are only listed on the table if they meet the requirements for scanning. For information about the criteria, see [Requirements for API scanning](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/scanner/api-scanning-reqs).


### Viewing and configuring authentication

 For OpenAPI definitions and Postman Collections, Burp automatically detects authentication methods when parsing the definition.
 These are listed in the **API details > Authentication** tab, where you can add credentials to enable Burp to use them during the scan. You can also add new authentication methods.

 For SOAP WSDLs, Burp doesn't currently detect authentication methods. You'll need to add authentication methods and their credentials to enable Burp to use them during the scan.

 For more information, see [Configuring authentication for API scans](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/running-scans/api-scans/authentication).

### Viewing parameters

 API parameters for all selected endpoints are listed in a table in the **API details > Parameters** tab. You can review these to better understand the scope of your scan.

#### Note

 If you deselect or delete an endpoint, Burp automatically removes any corresponding parameters from the **Parameters** tab.


 The table contains details of parameters in the following columns:

- **Name** - The name of the parameter as defined in the API definition.
- **Values** - One or more values taken from the example values for this parameter in the API definition. (If no values are specified in the API definition, Burp randomly generates them as needed during the
 scan. These generated values don't appear in the table.)
- **Description** (OpenAPI only) - The parameter description from the API definition.
-

**Method** -

  -

For SOAP, the name of the method that the parameter belongs to.
  -

For Postman, the name of the request that the parameter belongs to.

- **Location** - Where the API parameter is located in an HTTP request, as defined in the API definition. For example, the request body, or query string.

 Burp Scanner uses the parameter details to create requests when it audits an endpoint.

 Once you have finalized the endpoints you want to scan and reviewed the parameters, click **Next** to select a scan configuration.

## Step 4: Select a scan configuration

 Scan configurations are collections of settings that define how a scan runs. Click **Scan** to start the scan with the default configuration, or select and edit a scan configuration. You have the following options:

-

**Set up a new configuration** - You can either use a ready-made preset and start scanning immediately, or customize your own.
-

**Load a configuration** - Choose an existing configuration from your configuration library.

 When you've selected your scan configuration, click **Scan** to start the scan, or click on the **Resource pool** tab to choose a resource pool.

## Step 5: Select a resource pool

 A resource pool is a group of tasks that share a quota of network resources. The default resource pool is automatically selected. You can change this in the **Resource pools** tab:

-

To use a resource pool that already exists, select **Use existing resource pool**, then choose a pool from the list.
-

To set up a new resource pool, select **Create new resource pool**. For more information on how to configure the pool settings, see [Tasks settings - Resource pools](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/project/tasks#resource-pools).
