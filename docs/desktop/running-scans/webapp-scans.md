 This section explains how to configure and run web application scans in Burp Suite Professional.


 When scanning web applications, Burp automatically catalogs and analyzes the application's structure and traffic, including any REST, SOAP, and GraphQL APIs that it discovers. It adds all requests, responses, and resources found during the scan to the site map.

 API-only scans](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/running-scans/api-scans).


 Burp Scanner enables you to launch web application scans in the following ways:


- **Crawl and audit**. Burp Scanner maps the structure and endpoints of the target application, then runs a series of automated tests to probe for vulnerabilities.
- **Crawl**. Burp Scanner maps the structure and endpoints of a target without running any automated vulnerability checks.
- **Audit selected items**. This is useful if you want to audit a specific HTTP request that you think might be vulnerable.
