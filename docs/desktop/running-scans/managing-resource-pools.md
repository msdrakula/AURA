# Managing resource pools for scans

 A resource pool is a quota of resources that can be shared by multiple tasks. Resources pools make it easier for you to:


- Manage and prioritize the use of system resources, particularly across different scans.
- Test applications that tolerate automated requests at different rates.

 Resource pools are used by scans and live audit tasks. They are not available for passive crawl tasks.


 Each scan or live audit task is assigned to a resource pool when it is created. You can define the pool in the **Resource pool** tab in the scan launcher. Select an existing pool from the list, or create a new pool.


#### Note

 If you do not select a resource pool, the scan uses the default resource pool.


## Creating new resource pools

 To create a new resource pool from the **Resource pool** tab in the scan launcher:


1. Select **Create new resource pool**.
1. Enter a name for the pool.
1. Configure the pool throttling settings.

 Burp Suite creates the pool when you start the scan or live audit task. The pool is also added to the list of existing pools, for future use.


#### More information

For more information on the pool throttling settings available, see [Task settings - Resource pools](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/project/tasks#resource-pools).

## Reassigning resource pools

 You can move a scan or live audit task to another resource pool during an attack. This enables you to manage the use of system resources in real time.


 To reassign a task, click the  icon to edit the task. You can select a new resource pool from the list of existing pools, or create a new resource pool.
