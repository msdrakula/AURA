 These settings let you configure where Burp stores its temporary files.


 By default, Burp creates a directory in the temporary file location provided by the platform. If required, you can specify a custom directory instead. For example, you might want to use a different volume, or a location that is not externally readable.


#### Note

 On MacOS, you may find that the operating system sometimes clears the default temporary file location following system hibernation, causing Burp to lose any temporary files. To resolve this problem, configure a custom location for Burp to store temporary files.


 Changes to this setting take effect the next time that Burp starts up.


 The **Temporary files location** settings are user settings. They apply to all installations of Burp on your machine.
