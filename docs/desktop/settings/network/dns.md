 The **DNS** settings enable you to configure:


- [Preferred IP version for DNS resolution](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/network/dns#preferred-ip-version-for-dns-resolution).
- [Hostname resolution overrides](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/network/dns#hostname-resolution-overrides).

## Preferred IP version for DNS resolution

 These settings enable you to choose whether Burp prioritizes IPv4 or IPv6 addresses during DNS lookups, rather than relying on the operating system's default ordering. This is especially useful if routing restrictions allow only IPv4 or IPv6 traffic.


 You can choose from the following options:


- **Use system's default behavior**
- **Prefer IPv4**
- **Prefer IPv6**

 The **Preferred IP version for DNS resolution** settings are project settings. They apply to the current project only.


### Clearing the DNS cache

 Click **Clear DNS cache** to clear Burp's DNS cache.


## Hostname resolution overrides

 These settings enable you to override your computer's DNS resolution by mapping hostnames to IP addresses. This can help you to make sure that requests are forwarded correctly when the Hosts file has been modified to invisibly proxy traffic from non-proxy-aware thick client components.


 Each mapping comprises:


- A hostname.
- The IP address that should be associated with that hostname.

 You can enable or disable rules individually using the checkbox on the list, and **Edit** or **Remove** rules using the buttons to the side.


 The **Hostname resolution overrides** settings are project settings. They apply to the current project only.
