 When Burp Suite DAST discovers APIs through an integration, they appear in the **New** tab in API finder. You need to review these APIs and create sites for the ones you want to scan. APIs that you don't want to scan can be ignored.

#### Note

 When APIs are waiting for your review, a red dot appears on the **API finder** menu item.


## Creating API sites

 To review and create sites for discovered APIs, select **API finder** in the navigation bar.

 The **New** tab lists the APIs that Burp Suite DAST has discovered. For each API, you can see:

- The API type (REST, SOAP, or GraphQL).
- The number of endpoints. Click this to view the individual endpoints and their HTTP methods.
- The date the API was discovered.
- The source: the integration the API came from. Click this to view the connection details.

### Viewing API endpoints

 To view the endpoints for an API, click the endpoint count. A panel shows each endpoint's HTTP method, host, path, and content type. You can filter by HTTP method or search for a specific endpoint.

 To create a site directly from this panel, click **Create site from API**.

### Creating a site for a single API

 To create a site for a single API:

1. Click the **Create site**  icon in the
 **Actions** column of the API.
1. Click **Continue** to configure the site.

 For more information, see [Bulk uploading APIs](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-apis/adding-apis/bulk-uploading-apis).

 Burp Suite DAST creates a site for the API and adds it to the site tree. The API moves to the **Onboarded** tab.

### Creating sites for multiple APIs

 To create sites for multiple APIs at once:

1.
 Select the checkboxes next to the APIs you want to create sites for.

1.
 Click **Create sites** in the action bar that appears at the bottom of the page.

1.
 Click **Continue** to configure the sites. For more information, see [Bulk uploading APIs](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-apis/adding-apis/bulk-uploading-apis).


 Burp Suite DAST creates a site for each selected API and adds them to the site tree. The APIs move to the **Onboarded** tab.

## Viewing onboarded APIs

 The **Onboarded** tab lists APIs that have been turned into scan sites. For each API, you can see the source integration and a link to the site in the site tree.

## Ignoring APIs

 If you don't want to create a site for an API, you can ignore it. Ignored APIs move to the **Ignored** tab and no longer appear in the **New** tab.

 To ignore a single API, click the **Ignore** icon in the **Actions** column.

 To ignore multiple APIs at once:

1.
 Select the checkboxes next to the APIs you want to ignore.

1.
 Click **Ignore** in the action bar that appears at the bottom of the page.


## Restoring ignored APIs

 You can restore ignored APIs and move them back to the **New** tab if you want to create sites for them later.

 To restore a single API, click the **Restore** icon in the **Actions** column on the **Ignored** tab.

 To restore multiple APIs at once:

1.
 Go to the **Ignored** tab.

1.
 Select the checkboxes next to the APIs you want to restore.

1.
 Click **Revert**.
