 You can use our GraphQL API to integrate Burp Suite DAST with third-party applications. For web applications that send requests to the API using client-side JavaScript, you need to allowlist the origin of these requests for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).


 This enables you to develop more powerful integrated applications that can fetch the relevant data, create and edit sites, and launch new scans directly from the browser using AJAX.


#### Note

 Even if you're integrating Burp Suite DAST with your [CI/CD](https://portswigger.net/developers/ci-cd-security) system using our native plugins, you still need to allowlist your Jenkins or TeamCity URL in order to use the **Burp site-driven scan** option.


 You can allowlist as many origins as you want, each separated by a new line:


1.
 Log in to Burp Suite DAST as an administrator.

1.
 From the settings menu , select **Connectivity**.

1.

 In the **Allowed Origins for GraphQL API** section, enter the origin on which the other application is running. make sure that you include the URL scheme, domain name, and port. For example:
  `https://third-party-app.com:8082
https://custom-app.your-company.net:8083`
1.
 When you're sure your entries are correct, click **Save**.

1.
 Test your external application to make sure it works as expected.


 If you still run into CORS-related issues, examine the `Origin` header of the associated request and compare this to the URLs that you have in the allowlist. There should be no discrepancies.

#### Note

 The origin of incoming requests refers only to the URL scheme, domain name, and port. In other words, you can allowlist all cross-origin requests from `https://example.com:8080` but you cannot restrict this to specific subdirectories such as `https://example.com:8080/my-app`. For more granular control, you need to deploy your application to a dedicated subdomain:
 `https://your-app.example.com:8080`
