 You can integrate CI-driven scans with any CI/CD platform that supports containers. This enables you to use Burp Scanner to run scans as a stage in your existing CI/CD pipeline.


 Use this guide to quickly integrate a CI-driven scan with your chosen CI/CD platform. These instructions enable you to run a scan with the default scan configuration against a single URL, using a shell script.


## Before you start

 Before you start, you need to perform the following steps:


-

Deploy Burp Suite DAST.
-

Create an API user in the CI-driven scan initiator group, and save the API key. See [Creating API users](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/api-documentation/create-api-user).

## System requirements

 For information on the machine specification required to run a CI-driven scan, see the [System requirements for CI-driven scans](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/ci-cd/ci-driven-scans/ci-cd-system-requirements).


## Running a scan

 To run a CI-driven scan, include the following Docker run command in your pipeline script:
 `docker run --rm --pull=always \
-u $(id -u) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) \
-e BURP_ENTERPRISE_SERVER_URL=https://ent-server.com \
-e BURP_ENTERPRISE_API_KEY=XXXXxxxxXXXXxxxx \
-e BURP_START_URL=https://ginandjuice.shop \
-e BURP_CORRELATION_ID=my_vulnerable_website \
public.ecr.aws/portswigger/enterprise-scan-container:latest`

 You need to input the correct values for the environment variables in the command:


-

`BURP_ENTERPRISE_SERVER_URL`: This is the URL of your DAST server.
-

`BURP_ENTERPRISE_API_KEY`: This is the API key that you copied when you created an API user.
-

`BURP_START_URL`: This is the URL of the website you want Burp Scanner to scan.
-

`BURP_CORRELATION_ID`: This is optional. You only need to input a correlation ID if you want to view the scan results on the Burp Suite DAST web interface. Burp Suite DAST saves the results in a new site with the same name as the correlation ID. You can use a text string up to 64 characters long.

#### Note

 If you want to get an idea of how Burp Scanner works and how the results are displayed, you may want to scan our deliberately vulnerable website, [https://vulnerable-website.com](https://vulnerable-website.com).


 You can also apply custom extensions, BChecks, and BApps to CI-driven scans. For more information, see [Using custom extensions, BChecks, and BApps with CI-driven scans](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/ci-cd/ci-driven-scans/create-config#using-custom-extensions-bchecks-and-bapps-with-ci-driven-scans).


#### Warning

 For security reasons, only use custom extensions, BChecks, and BApps that you trust.


## Setting the public key certificate

 If your DAST server uses a self-signed TLS certificate, you need to provide the full public certificate chain to the Docker container via the `BURP_ENTERPRISE_SERVER_TLS_CERTIFICATE` environment variable.


 Make sure your certificate file contains the full public certificate chain and is accessible from the location where you run the `docker run` command. Then pass it in as follows:


`-e BURP_ENTERPRISE_SERVER_TLS_CERTIFICATE="$(cat self-signed-cert.pem)"`

 Alternatively, you can include your TLS certificate with the configuration file. For more information, see [Creating a configuration file for a CI-driven scan](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/ci-cd/ci-driven-scans/create-config).


## Scan results

 The results from Burp Scanner are available as a JUnit XML file when a scan is complete. The file is saved as `burp_junit_report.xml` in the working directory of the container for your CI-driven scan.


## Remediation advice

 The results from Burp Scanner include remediation advice for any security issues they find. This advice includes links to relevant sections of the free Web Security Academy resource, which provide further detail on web security vulnerabilities.


## Evidence

 The results from Burp Scanner include evidence for any security issues found. This evidence includes the request sent by Burp Scanner to produce the issue, as well as the response sent by the application.


## Configuring CI-driven scans

 To use more advanced features, such as custom scan configurations or application logins with CI-driven scans, you need to create a configuration file.


 CI-driven scan configuration files work with any CI platform that supports containers.
