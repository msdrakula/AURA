 In order to run scans successfully, make sure that your infrastructure meets the following requirements:


-
 We recommend that you run a CI-driven scan on a machine that has a minimum of 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of RAM. We also recommend that you have 30 GB of free disk space. While this should be suitable for most use cases, larger or more complex target applications may require more resources.

-
 Your CI/CD build agent or node must be configured to run Docker containers.

-
 The CI/CD build agent or node where the container is running must be able to access PortSwigger's public image repository `public.ecr.aws/portswigger/`, as well as the target application you want to scan.


## Network and firewall configuration

 To run CI-driven scans, you need to perform some network and firewall configuration. There are different configuration requirements for Cloud and self-hosted instances of Burp Suite DAST.

-
 Outbound access from your scanning containers to the **Dashboard IPs** listed on the [PortSwigger IP ranges](https://ip-ranges.portswigger.cloud/) page.

-

Outbound access from your scan containers to `*.oastify.com` on port 443.
