When you add a new site, you need to configure your network and firewall settings to enable Burp Suite DAST to scan your site effectively. This includes:

-

Allowing access to your site from the infrastructure on which your scans will run.
-

Allowing outbound connections to the public Burp Collaborator server. This enables Burp Scanner to use out-of-band application security testing (OAST) techniques to test whether an attacker could induce your site to interact with arbitrary external services. For more information, see [Burp Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/collaborator).

The configuration depends on whether you have a Cloud or self-hosted instance of Burp Suite DAST.

For details, see the relevant section below.

## Cloud instances

If you want to run scans of the site on Cloud scanning machines:

-

Allow inbound access to your site from the **Scanner IPs** listed on the [PortSwigger IP ranges](https://ip-ranges.portswigger.cloud/) page.
-

Allow outbound access from your site to `*.oastify.com` on ports `80` and `443`.

If you want to run scans of the site on self-hosted scanning machines:

-

Allow inbound access to your site from the IP addresses of your scanning machines.
-

Allow outbound access from your site to `*.oastify.com` on ports `80` and `443`.

If you want to run CI-driven scans of your site:

-

Allow inbound access to your site from your scan containers.
-

Allow outbound access from your site to `*.oastify.com` on ports `80` and `443`.

#### Note

These options are not mutually exclusive. You can enable all of them for your site.

## Self-hosted instances

To allow your scanning machines to scan your site effectively:

-

Allow inbound access to your site from the IP addresses of your scanning machines.
-

Allow outbound access from your site to `*.oastify.com` on ports `80` and `443`.

If you want to run CI-driven scans of your site:

-

Allow inbound access to your site from your CI/CD platform agents.
-

Allow outbound access from your site to `*.oastify.com` on ports `80` and `443`.

#### Note

These options are not mutually exclusive. You can enable all of them for your site.
