 In Burp Suite DAST, the **Sites** page contains a list of sites that you have configured, which each represent a website or web application that you want to scan and track. You can click on a site to view more information about it.


 Sites can be organized into a hierarchical tree structure using [folders](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/reference/folders). You can set up the site tree however you want. For example, you might choose to group websites based on their geographical location or based on the different teams of developers that work on them. You can also [restrict user access](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/users-and-permissions/managing-groups#restricting-access-to-sites) to certain parts of the site tree based on this folder structure.


 Once you've run a few scans, the **Sites** page will also provide an overview of how many issues need your attention in each site or folder.


## Site filters

 The filter buttons let you show or hide items based on particular features:


-  **Scanning** shows the sites that are currently being scanned.

-  **Issues** shows the sites that have problems that need your attention.

-  **Scan failures** shows sites where the scan has failed.


 If you want to see more information about a specific site, click on the site name to see the [site-level view](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/reference/site-level-view).


## Site actions

 Depending on your permissions, you can also perform various actions using the icons to the right of each site or folder.


 For folders, you can:


-
 Create new sites and subfolders within the folder.
