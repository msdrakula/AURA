 You can view and manage individual steps in your recorded login sequences. This is useful when you want to modify specific actions without editing the entire JSON script.

#### Note

 To manage steps in a recorded login sequence, you need permissions for the site to **View site application login details** and **Edit site application logins**. For more information, see [Role-based access control](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/users-and-permissions/role-based-access-control).


## Viewing steps

 When you edit a recorded login, you can view the individual steps in your login sequence on the **Steps** tab. This gives you a visual list of all the actions in the sequence.

 To view the steps in a recorded login:

1.
 In the site's **Details** tab, click  **Edit**.

1.
 In **Scan settings > Authentication**, click the  pencil icon next to the recorded login sequence.

1.
 In the **Steps** tab, the list shows all the steps in your recorded login sequence.


 Each step shows the action type and a summary of what it does. You can switch to the **Script** tab to view the JSON-based script.

## Step types

 Your recorded login sequence can include the following step types:

- **Navigate**: Goes to a specified URL.
- **Click**: Clicks an element on the page.
- **Type**: Types text into an element on the page.
- **Wait**: Pauses for a specified duration.
- **Key press**: Presses a keyboard key.
- **TOTP**: Generates a Time-based One-Time Password and types it into a specified field. For more information, see [Configuring TOTP MFA](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-web-apps/configure-authentication/totp-mfa).
- **WebAuthn configuration**: Indicates that your login contains WebAuthn passkeys. Appears as the first step, regardless of where the passkey step occurs in your login sequence. Cannot be edited. For more information, see [WebAuthn passkeys in recorded logins](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-web-apps/configure-authentication/webauthn).

## Selector types

 When you add a **Click** or **Type** step, you need to tell the scanner how to find the element on the page. You do this by choosing a selector type and entering a value.

 The selector type determines how the scanner locates elements on the page:

- **ID**: Finds an element by its unique ID attribute. This is the most reliable option if the element has an ID.
- **Link href**: Finds an element by its href attribute. This is best for links and buttons.
- **Name**: Finds an element by its name attribute. This is commonly used for form fields.
- **Aria label**: Finds an element by its aria-label attribute. This is useful for accessible web apps.
- **Class name**: Finds an element by its CSS class. Use this when the element has a unique class name.
- **Text content**: Finds an element by its visible text. This is useful for buttons.
- **Text nodes**: Finds an element by the text of elements inside it. Use this when the element you're clicking doesn't have text, but an element inside it does.
- **XPath**: Finds an element using an XPath expression. Use this when other selector types don't work.

 In most cases, you can use **ID** or **Name**. If these don't work, try **Link href** for links and buttons, **Text content** or **Text nodes** for buttons, or **XPath** for more complex scenarios.

 You can add multiple selectors for a single step, with a maximum of one selector for each type. When you add multiple selectors, the scanner uses them in priority order. The order shown above is the priority order, with **ID** having the highest priority and **XPath** the lowest.

## Advanced settings

 When you add a **Click**, **Type**, or **Key press** step, you can configure advanced settings to control how the scanner interacts with your application. Make sure you understand the relevant web technologies before editing these settings.

### Browser settings

 Browser settings tell the scanner how your web app responds to a step. Configure these settings to match your application's behavior:

- **Opens new tab**: Select this if the step opens a new browser tab.
- **Closes tab**: Select this if the step closes the current browser tab.
- **Causes navigation**: Select this if the step navigates to a different URL.

 You can select multiple options if needed. For example, a button might both cause navigation and open a new tab.

### Shadow parent

 Some modern web applications use shadow DOM to encapsulate parts of the page. If an element is inside a shadow DOM, the scanner needs to know where to look for it.

 Enable the **Shadow parent** setting if:

- Your application uses web components (custom HTML elements like `<login-form>` or `<app-input>`).
- The scanner can't find the element during replay, even though your selector is correct.

 You can leave this setting disabled for most standard login forms.

## Adding a step

    - Choose a **Selector type** and enter a value to tell Burp how to find the TOTP input field on the page.
    - Optional: Expand **Advanced settings** to configure **Browser settings** or **Shadow parent** options.
