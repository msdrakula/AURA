 This page explains how to review AI-enhanced scan results in Burp Suite DAST.

 Once Burp AI has investigated an issue, it adds its findings to the **Details** section of the **Issues** tab. For information on how to access this page, see [Viewing issue details](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/work-with-scan-results/viewing-issues).

## Burp AI outcomes

 When Burp AI investigates an issue, it returns a Burp AI outcome. This is displayed on the **Issues** page and in the **Severity** section of the **Advisory** tab.

 There are two possible outcomes:

- **Issue confirmed** - Burp AI confirmed that the issue is real and exploitable.
- **Inconclusive** - Burp AI couldn't confirm that the issue is real and exploitable. This does not necessarily mean the issue is a false positive. In this case, further manual testing is required to fully validate the severity and impact of the issue.

 You can filter the **Issues** tab by Burp AI outcome.

## Viewing details of Burp AI's investigation

 Issues that Burp AI has explored also display a **Burp AI results** section on the **Advisory** tab. This is separate from the **Scanner results** section:

- **Scanner results**: This shows the original findings discovered when Burp Scanner detected the issue.
- **Burp AI results**: This shows the AI's independent investigation, including its own testing and conclusions.

 The **Burp AI results** section contains the following information:

- **Summary**: A short description of what Burp AI tested and observed.
- **Impact**: An overview of the potential security impact. This helps you assess risk and prioritize next steps.
- **Evidence**: The proof of the issue found by Burp AI. This may include requests and responses, payloads, or observed behavior.
- **Details**: Full technical details of what Burp AI observed when investigating the issue.
- **Reproduction steps**: A guide on how to manually reproduce Burp AI's findings.

 You can use the **Copy** buttons to copy the contents of the **Burp AI results** section. This makes it easy to share these results with security teams or other stakeholders.

## Running an AI investigation manually

 You can manually run a Burp AI investigation on an issue after a scan has finished. This can be useful if Burp AI originally skipped the issue due to your scan settings.

 To do this, open the issue details page for the issue and click **Investigate issue**.

 You can manually investigate any issue, except Collaborator or Infiltrator issues. If an issue already has Burp AI results, running **Investigate issue** overwrites the current AI investigation for that issue.

## Reporting on AI-enhanced results

 AI-enhanced results are included in all report types. Detailed reports and compliance reports include the full **Burp AI results** section for each issue.

 You cannot generate a report for a scan while Burp AI is still investigating issues.
