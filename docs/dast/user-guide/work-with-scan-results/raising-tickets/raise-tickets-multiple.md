 You can raise tickets for several issues at once. You can also group similar issues together on one ticket, which minimizes the number of tickets that you need to manage.


 To raise new tickets for multiple issues, do the following:


1.
 In Burp Suite DAST, go to **Scans > Issues**.

1.

 Select the checkbox for each of the issues that you want to raise a ticket for. A menu bar appears with options for raising tickets. You can only see options for the issue tracking platforms that your administrator has configured. For more information, refer to [integrating issue tracking platforms](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/integrate-issue-tracking-platforms).

1.
 Click the button for your preferred issue tracking platform.

1.

 Choose how you want tickets to be raised if there are several issues of the same type:


  -
 To raise a separate ticket for each issue, select **For each issue**.

  -
 If you want to combine all the issues of the same type into one ticket, select **For each issue type**.


1.
 Click **Create**.



 Notice that icons appear in the **Linked tickets** column to show that the issues are linked to Jira, GitLab, or Trello.


#### Note

 If necessary, you can repeat this process to raise tickets on a different issue tracking platform.


## Linking multiple issues to an existing ticket

For more information, refer to [integrating issue tracking platforms](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/integrate-issue-tracking-platforms).

 Click the button for your preferred issue tracking platform.

1.
 Select **Link to existing ticket**.

1.
 Enter the ticket number, and click **Link**.

-
 To see more information about a ticket, expand the entry in the **Type** column. You can view a list of the issues that are linked to the ticket. You can also see the ticket status and priority.
