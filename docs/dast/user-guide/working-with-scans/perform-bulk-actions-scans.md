 The bulk actions menu enables you to cancel or delete multiple scans at the same time. You can also use the **Scan again** option to scan the selected sites again, using the same configurations as before.


 To perform bulk actions on scans:


-
 From the top menu, select **Scans**.

-
 To select the relevant scans, use the checkboxes to the left of the screen.

-
 In the bulk actions menu, click **Scan again**, **Cancel**, or **Delete**.


#### Note

 You can't use the **Scan again** or **Cancel** actions on CI-driven scans, as the scans are managed in external environments.


 If you click **Delete**, you delete the data that Burp Suite DAST stores about the CI-driven scans.
