 Burp Suite DAST enables you to scan your sites for security issues. You can create one-off scans or schedule recurring scans for one or more of your sites and folders.


#### Note

 Before you can create any scans, you need to create a site. Sites can contain web apps or APIs that you want to scan.


 Your scanning machines must be able to access the sites you want to scan. For information on allowing access, see [Configuring your environment network and firewall settings](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/standard/network-firewall-config).


## Scheduling scans for a folder

 When you schedule a recurring scan for a folder, you create a scan for each of the sites in the folder.


-
 If you move a site out of the folder, you remove the scheduled scan for the site.

-
 If you add a site to the folder, you add the scheduled scan to the site.


## Creating a new scan

 To create a new scan:


1.
 From the **Sites** menu, select the sites and folders that you want to scan.

1.
 From the menu at the bottom of the screen, click **Scan**.

1.
 Choose when you want the scan to start. By default, scans start immediately.

1.
 Choose how often the scan should repeat. By default, scans repeat weekly.

1.
 When you're happy with your scan settings, click **Save**.

1.
 Go to **Scans > Scheduled scans** to see your new scan in the list.


#### Note

 If you select a folder that contains one or more sites that you don't have permission to view and scan, you won't be able to create the scan.


 To create a scan for the sites that you do have permission to view and scan, deselect the folder, and select the sites individually.


## CI-driven scans

 You can create scans in external environments, such as in your CI/CD pipeline. For more information, see [Integrating CI-driven scans](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/ci-cd/ci-driven-scans).
