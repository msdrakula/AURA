 You need to create a site in order to scan a web app. You can add an unlimited number of sites. In this context, the term **web app** refers to an application that runs on a web server and is accessed via a web browser.


 Before you add your first web app site, you need to configure your network and firewall settings. For more information, see [Configuring network and firewall settings for a site](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/managing-your-sites/configuring-network-and-firewall-settings).


 To add a new web app site:


1.

Select **Sites > Add a new site** to go to the **Create a new site** page.
1.

Under **Site type**, select **Web app**.
1.

Enter a unique **Site name**.
1.

To add the web app site to an existing folder, select from the **Site folder** drop-down menu. If you leave this field blank then the web app site is created at the top level of the site tree.
1.

Enter the **Start URLs** that you want all the scans of this web app site to start from. No wildcards are permitted.
1.

If necessary, configure the site scope to refine which URLs to scan. For more information, see [setting the site scope](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-web-apps/setting-site-scope).
1.

If necessary, specify your own protocols instead of **HTTP & HTTPS**. For more information, see [Protocol Settings](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-web-apps#protocol-settings).
1.

Scroll down to **Scan settings > Scan configuration** and select a scan configuration for the web app site. You can either use a preset scan mode or a custom configuration. For more information, see For more information, see [Defining the scan configuration for a site](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/managing-your-sites/site-settings/scan-configurations).
1.

Click **Save**.

 Burp Suite DAST adds the new web app site to the site tree and prompts you to perform a pre-scan check.


#### Note

 When you scan a web app, Burp Scanner also scans any APIs that it finds within the site scope. If you want to scan specific APIs, see [Scanning APIs](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-apis).


 If you want to run some test scans before you add your own web apps, you can use `vulnerable-website.com`. This is a demo web app with a few intentional vulnerabilities.


## Optional settings for your new web app site

 When you add a new web app site, you can configure a number of settings.


### Detailed scope configuration

 The site scope defines the locations that Burp Scanner can visit. By default, Burp Suite DAST automatically uses your **Start URLs** to derive the site scope.


 You can refine the scope using URL prefixes (**Basic**) or regex patterns (**Advanced**). This enables you to target Burp Scanner on the locations you're interested in, and exclude any locations you want to avoid. For more information, see [setting the site scope](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/scanning-web-apps/setting-site-scope).


### Protocol settings

 If you don't specify a protocol, Burp Scanner uses both HTTP and HTTPS. To specify your own protocols:


1.
 Under **Site scope > Protocol settings**, select **Scan using my specified protocols**.

1.
 Enter `https://` or `http://` at the beginning of the **Start URL**.

1.
 Enter `https://` or `http://` at the beginning of any URLs you added in the **In-scope URL prefixes** or **Out-of-scope URL prefixes** tabs.


### Scan settings

 You can specify a range of optional settings for your scan. For example, you can set:


- Scan configurations
- Application logins
- AI-enhanced scanning
- Extensions

To specify these, go to **Scan settings** for your site or folder. For more information, see
 [Configuring site settings](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/managing-your-sites/site-settings).


#### Note

 We recommend keeping a consistent scan configuration for each site you add. Changing the scan configuration can affect issue trends over time and cause Burp Suite DAST to give inaccurate time estimates while scanning.


 If you want to scan a web app that you have already added with a new configuration, we recommend adding the app again with the new configuration selected.
