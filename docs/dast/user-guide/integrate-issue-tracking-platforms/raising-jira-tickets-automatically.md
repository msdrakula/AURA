 You can raise Jira tickets automatically for issues that match the specific severity and confidence levels that you set.


#### Note

 To avoid creating a large number of tickets, we recommend that you set high severity and confidence levels to begin with. You can add lower severities and confidence levels once you have a better understanding of how many tickets are created as a result of your scans.


1.
 From the settings menu , select **Integrations** and find the Jira panel. Click **Edit**.

1.
 Under **Raise tickets automatically**, click **Add rule**.

1.
 Enter a name for the rule. You can also add a description.

1.
 Select one or more severity levels and confidence levels that cause a ticket to be raised. Click **Next**.

1.
 Select all the sites that you want the rule to apply to. Click **Next**.

1.
 Select a project from the **Project** drop-down list. Start typing to search the available projects.

1.
 Select a ticket type from the **Ticket type** drop-down list. Start typing to search the available ticket types.

1.
 If required, select a parent from the **Parent** drop-down list. Start typing to search the available Jira parents.

1.
 Click **Next**. The **Custom ticket fields** tab opens.


## Adding custom ticket fields

 Burp Suite DAST detects if your Jira project has fields that are compulsory when you raise a ticket. The **Custom ticket fields** tab enables you to automatically fill these fields.

 You can also add custom ticket fields that are optional.

#### Note

 We currently support the following ticket field types:


-
 Text strings

-
 Numbers

-
 Single select lists

-
 Multi-select lists


 If your project requires fields that are a different type, Burp Suite DAST won't be able to raise tickets.


To automatically fill custom ticket fields:

1.
 In the **Custom ticket fields** tab, enter a Jira value for each **Required Jira field**.

1.

To add a **Jira value** to an optional custom field:

  -
 Click **Add more fields**.

  -
 Enter values for your **Jira field** and **Jira value**.

  -
 To add an additional custom field, click the  **Configure optional fields** button.


1.
 Click **Save**.


## Raising tickets for previously found issues

 When you create an automatic rule, it will raise Jira tickets when you run your next scan.

 You can also raise tickets for issues that were found by your most recent successful scan, that meet your new rule. Select the tick box for **Raise tickets for all issues from the most recent successful scan**.

 The process of raising tickets for these issues begins when you click **Save**.

#### Note

 If you select this option for a large number of sites, it may take some time to raise all the relevant tickets.


## Duplicating rules for automatic tickets

 You can duplicate the rules you've already created for raising tickets. This makes it easy to raise tickets for different projects or severities, for example.

 To duplicate the rules for automatic ticket creation:

1.
 From the settings menu , select **Integrations** and find the Jira panel. Click **Edit**.

1.
 Find the ticket rules you want to duplicate, and click the options menu . Select **Create a duplicate**.

1.
 Enter a new name for your rule, and edit the rule as necessary.

1.
 When you finish editing the rule, click **Save**.
