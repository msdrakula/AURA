Cloud

 This guide explains how to use our migration tool to move data from your Linux self-hosted instance to PortSwigger's secure cloud.


 You can use our migration tool to transfer:


-

Sites and folders
-

Custom scan configurations
-

Extensions
-

BChecks
-

Groups and roles (but not users)
-

Scheduled recurring scans
-

## Prerequisites

 Make sure your self-hosted instance is using the latest software version.


-

To check your version, click the  icon in the upper-right corner of the screen and select **About**.
-

If you need to update your instance, download the installer from the [release page](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases.html#dast).

## Export your data

 To export your data:


1.

Run the following command from the Burp Suite DAST installation folder: `sudo
/opt/<your-installation-directory>/exportDataForSaasMigration`
1.

You will see a warning message. Enter `y` to continue.
1.

Make a note of where the output file is saved.

 The data is exported as a ZIP file.


#### Note

 You must use `sudo`, because the tool needs to read the configuration and access the installation directory.


## Import your data

 Use the GraphQL API to import your data:


1.

Create an API user and API key in the Burp Suite DAST UI. For more information, see [Creating API users](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/api-documentation/create-api-user).
1.

Run the following command, replacing the required fields in the brackets: `sudo
/opt/<your-installation-directory>/importDataForSaasMigration \
   --cloud-url=<cloud-url> \
   --api-key=<api-key-from-cloud-instance> \
   --data-file=<path-to-export-data-file.zip> \
   --have-permission-to-scan=<y-or-n> \
   --resume-previous-import=<y-or-n>`

Enter the required fields as follows:

-

`cloud-url` The URL of the instance of Burp Suite DAST that is importing the data. For example, `https://my-company.portswigger.cloud`.
-

`api-key` The API key of the user that is importing the data.
-

`data-file` The path and filename of the export zip file, created by the export tool.

Enter the optional fields as follows:

-

`have-permission-to-scan` Confirm that you have permission to scan all the URLs included in the site scope.
-

`resume-previous-import` Select `y` if you previously started an import, and want to resume it.

 This process creates a progress file that can be used to resume an import, using the `resume-previous-import` field.


 You can confirm that you have permission to scan the imported sites using the `have-permission-to-scan` field. If you don't, you will be asked for confirmation.


#### Note

 The import only works on clean cloud instances. If your cloud instance already contains data, the tool may stop with errors (for example, due to duplicate scan configurations or extensions).


## Scan schedule behavior after migration

 Once you migrate to PortSwigger's secure cloud, your scan schedules behave as follows:


-

One-off scans are not exported.
-

Recurring scans continue, based on their schedule.
-

If a recurring scan was set to repeat a certain number of times, this behavior will not change.
-

Custom scan configurations are marked as created by the API user who runs the import.
