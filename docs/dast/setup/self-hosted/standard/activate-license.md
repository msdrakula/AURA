 When you log in to Burp Suite DAST for the first time, you are prompted to activate your license before you can begin using the product.


#### Note

 Before you activate, please be aware of the following requirements:


-

 In order to activate your license, the DAST server must be able to connect to `portswigger.net` on port `443`.
 Refer to [Configuring your environment network and firewall settings](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/standard/network-firewall-config).

-

 If you are not able to connect to the public internet from your machine,
 then you may need to [configure an HTTP proxy](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/post-installation-config/configure-http-proxy-server).

-

 For a single instance of Burp Suite DAST, you only need one license. It doesn't matter how many scanning machines you deploy, or how many scans you run.
 However, if you want to deploy separate instances of Burp Suite DAST in multiple environments, you must purchase a separate license for each instance.
 This also applies to test, development, or staging environments, for example.

-

 If you want to deploy additional Burp Suite DAST servers (for example, for testing in staging or development), you must purchase a separate license for each.
 Data is not shared between servers.


 If you have any questions about your licensing requirements, please contact our customer support team at hello@portswigger.net.


To activate your Burp Suite DAST license:

1.
 When prompted, click **Upload license key** and select the license key that you downloaded earlier.
 If you can't find your key, you can download it again from your [account page](https://portswigger.net/users/youraccount) on `portswigger.net`.

1.
 If your license was activated successfully, the system displays a confirmation message. If a connection could not be established to `portswigger.net`, you are prompted to [configure an HTTP proxy](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/post-installation-config/configure-http-proxy-server) before continuing.

1.
 Once you activate your license, this page shows the license expiry date and the number of concurrent scans included. You can purchase licenses to add more concurrent scans at any time.
