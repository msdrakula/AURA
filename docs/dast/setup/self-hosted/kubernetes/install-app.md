# Installing the application (Kubernetes)

 Burp Suite DAST uses Helm to manage installation and configuration. In order to install the application you first need to download its Helm chart.


## Downloading the Helm chart

 The Burp Suite DAST Helm chart is a deployment descriptor for Kubernetes that, when run, configures Burp Suite DAST in a "ready-to-run" state. It is designed to work with any Kubernetes cluster that meets the prerequisites for Burp Suite DAST.


 You can get the Helm chart from two places:


-

From the PortSwigger Releases page. Click [here](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/enterprise/latest?platform=kubernetes) to display details of the most recent Kubernetes release of Burp Suite DAST, and then click **Download**.

Once the chart is downloaded, unpack it into a directory of your choice. Note that you will need the name of this directory when running commands against the chart.
-

From the [Burp Suite DAST Helm chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/PortSwigger/enterprise-helm-charts).

#### Note

 While it is technically possible to customize the Helm chart, please note that we are unable to offer support on this process. For more information on Kubernetes support, see [Support scope for Kubernetes instances](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/kubernetes/support-scope).


## Providing custom values for the Helm chart

 The provided `values.yaml` file contains the default values that will be passed to the Helm chart when you run it. You can modify this file to customize these values. Please contact our support team if you need any additional guidance.


### Note for Oracle users

 If you want to use an Oracle database, you need to manually enable Oracle support by modifying the provided `values.yaml` file as follows:
 `support
    oracle: true`

## Adding a TLS certificate

 A TLS certificate makes sure your connection to Burp Suite DAST is secure. You can use the `values.yaml` file to add a TLS certificate.


 The TLS certificate must have the following properties:


-
 Use a `PKCS#12` certificate with a `.p12` file extension. The `.pfx` format is not supported.

-
 The certificate must have a passphrase.

-
 The certificate must include a Subject Alternative Name (SAN).


 To add a TLS certificate:


1.

 Use the following command to create a Kubernetes secret that contains your TLS certificate. The secret needs to contain the certificate, and the passphrase:
  `kubectl -n <namespace> create secret generic bsee-web-server-https --from-file=certificate=<your certificate name>.p12 --from-literal=passphrase=<your passphrase>`
1.

 In the `values.yaml` file, set the values for `services.webServer` as follows:


  -
 Set `useDeprecatedHttpConfigFromDatabase` to `false`.

  -
 Set `useHttps` to `true`.

  -
 Set a value for the `httpsPort` (the default is 8443).

  -
 Enter the `name` and `key` for the secrets for the `certificate` and the `passphrase`.


#### Note

 If you later decide to switch between an HTTPS and an HTTP connection, you need to set `useHttps` to `false`, and perform a Helm upgrade.


## Configuring TLS cipher suites

You can configure the enabled TLS cipher suites to meet your own security requirements, or to comply with specific standards.

#### Note

 This configuration controls cipher suites for external communication with Burp Suite DAST only. You cannot configure the cipher suites used internally between Burp Suite DAST components.


To configure the enabled TLS cipher suites, set the environment variable `BSEE_TLS_CIPHER_SUITES` as follows:

-  `DEFAULT`: Use secure TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 cipher suites only.

-  `TLS1.3`: Use secure TLS 1.3 cipher suites only.

-  `FIPS-140-2`: Use the cipher suites that are compatible with TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, and are considered secure by FIPS-140-2.


 If you want to create a custom configuration, you can list more than one cipher suite in the environment variable. For example, you can combine a preset with some additional cipher suites:
 `BSEE_TLS_CIPHER_SUITES=FIPS-140-2,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`

 You can see the full list of the ciphers we currently support in the `enterpriseServer` log. For more information, see [Support pack](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/troubleshooting/self-hosted/standard-deployment#support-pack).


## Configuring the database details

 Before you attempt to connect to your database, please make sure that you have configured it to work with Burp Suite DAST. For details of how to do this, see [Setting up the external database](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/kubernetes/setup-external-database).


 In the `values.yaml` file, set the values for `database` within the quote marks, as follows:


-
 Set `url` to the JDBC URL of your database. The format for the URL changes depending on the type of database you want to use. For more information on JDBC URLs in Burp Suite DAST, see [Database connection URL format](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/kubernetes/setup-external-database#database-connection-url-format).

-

 Set `enterpriseServerUsername` for the user that you want DAST server to use to connect to the database.


  -
 Additionally, if your database requires a different format for the username when connecting externally (for example, user-name@server-name), set `enterpriseServerConnectionUsername` to the connection username.


-
 Set `enterpriseServerPassword` to the password for the DAST server database connection.

-

 Set `scanningResourceUsername` to the username of the scanning machine database user.


  -
 Additionally, if your database requires a different format for the username when connecting externally (for example, user-name@server-name), set `scanningResourceConnectionUsername` for the scanning machine database user.


-
 Set `scanningResourcePassword` to the password of the scanning machine database user.


## Using the Helm chart

 After downloading the Helm chart, to deploy Burp Suite DAST, first make sure that you have created the namespace that you want to use. This is the same namespace that you used for your `PersistentVolumeClaim`.


 Next, run the following command:
 `helm install -n <namespace> <deployment name> <name of directory containing the chart>`

 For example, to use a chart located in `enterprise-helm-folder` to deploy Burp Suite DAST to a deployment called `bsee-deployment` with a namespace of `bsee-namespace`, you would run:
 `helm install -n bsee-namespace bsee-deployment enterprise-helm-folder`

### Extracting the web server IP address

 Once the installation process is complete, you need to extract your Burp Suite DAST external IP address to access the application. If you've used our template, the address of the webserver console is displayed after successful deployment. Otherwise run the following command to find the address:
 `kubectl get services -n <namespace>`

 This command displays details of all services in the namespace, including their external IP address. The external IP of the web server service is the IP you need to access Burp Suite DAST.


#### Note

 If you've used your own Ingress controller, you need to use your own configured address.


## Installing using a pre-existing values file

 You may have previously had a Kubernetes instance of Burp Suite DAST with a customized values file. If so, you need to use the same values file for your new instance. You can specify the values file to use when you run the install command.


 To specify a values file, add the `-f <values file name>` argument to the `install` command. For example:
 `helm install -n bsee-namespace bsee-deployment enterprise-helm-folder -f my-values-file`

#### Warning

 There are potential security implications to leaving Burp Suite DAST in an unconfigured state. We recommend completing the rest of the configuration as soon as possible.
