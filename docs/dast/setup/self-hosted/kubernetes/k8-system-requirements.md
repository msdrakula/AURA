 You can deploy Burp Suite DAST to Kubernetes. We provide a Helm chart with the correct field values to meet the minimum system requirements.

#### Note

 We recommend that you only attempt to deploy and manage Burp Suite DAST in a Kubernetes environment if you have previous Kubernetes experience.

 To deploy [Burp Suite DAST to Kubernetes](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/kubernetes), you need an external database that meets our [system requirements](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/kubernetes/external-database-requirements). You also need a cluster that meets the following requirements:

- An ingress solution, for example a load balancer or an ingress controller.
- A `PersistentVolume` with `ReadWriteMany` access mode. We recommend that this is backed by POSIX-compatible storage.
- A `PersistentVolumeClaim` bound to the `PersistentVolume`. This must have `ReadWriteMany` access mode, to allow simultaneous read/write access from multiple nodes. Make sure the `PersistentVolumeClaim` is located in the namespace where Burp Suite DAST will be deployed.
- (Optional) To enable cluster node [autoscaling](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/managing-scanning-resources/self-hosted/kubernetes), install and enable the cluster-autoscaler.

#### Note

 We don't recommend object storage solutions such as Google Cloud storage buckets, due to performance and compatibility issues.


 Burp Suite DAST can run on an x86-based cluster. There may be additional infrastructure configuration required depending on your Kubernetes environment. Please refer to our [Kubernetes support scope](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/kubernetes/support-scope) and [setup guide](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/kubernetes).

## Container system requirements

 We specify the hardware resources for the containers in our Helm chart values file.

#### Note

 Make sure your cluster node type is set appropriately for your environment.

 CentOS/RHEL v7.x operating systems are not supported for the cluster worker node.
