# Configuring your web server (Kubernetes)

 After installation, we recommend setting up the web server URL. This is necessary to use many of the features of Burp Suite DAST. For example, the web server URL is used to generate links sent by email from the server, such as password reset emails.


 To configure the web server, do the following:


1.
 From the settings menu , select **Network**.

1.
 Enter the **Web server URL**.


 The first time you log in as an admin user, add your web server URL in the format `https://your-web-server-IP:8443` or the fully qualified domain name of the machine on which you installed the web server.


 The default port number is `8443`. To use HTTPS, you also need to upload your [TLS certificate](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/kubernetes/configure-web-server#enabling-tls).


#### Note

 Use the Helm chart to set the web server port that the ingress will send traffic to. The external port used by the ingress may be different. The **Web server URL** needs to use the external port.


## Enabling TLS

 By default the web server is configured to use HTTPS with a temporary self-signed certificate. We recommend that you update the TLS certificate with your own.


 The TLS certificate must have the following properties:


-
 Use a `PKCS#12` certificate with a `.p12` file extension. The `.pfx` format is not supported.

-
 The certificate must have a password.

-
 The certificate must include a Subject Alternative Name (SAN).


 To add a TLS certificate:


1.

Use the following command to create a Kubernetes secret that contains your TLS certificate. The secret needs to contain the certificate, and the passphrase: `kubectl -n <namespace> create secret generic bsee-web-server-https --from-file=certificate=<your certificate name>.p12 --from-literal=passphrase=<your passphrase>`
1.

In the `values.yaml` file, set the values for `services.webServer` as follows:

  -
 Set `useDeprecatedHttpConfigFromDatabase` to `false`.

  -
 Set `useHttps` to `true`.

  -
 Set a value for the `httpsPort` (the default is `8443`).

  -

Enter the `name` and `key` for the secrets for the `certificate` and the `passphrase`. For example: `httpsCertificateSecret:
    name: bsee-web-server-https
    key: certificate
httpsPassphraseSecret:
    name: bsee-web-server-https
    key: passphrase`

1.
 Restart your deployment to apply the changes.


#### Note

 If you later decide to switch from an HTTPS to an HTTP connection, you need to set `useHttps` to `false`, and perform a Helm upgrade.


 If necessary, you can [configure an HTTP proxy server](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/user-guide/post-installation-config/configure-http-proxy-server) to allow you to connect to the public internet.
