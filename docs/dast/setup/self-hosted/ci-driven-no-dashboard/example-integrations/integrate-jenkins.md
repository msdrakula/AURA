# Integrating a CI-driven scan with no dashboard with Jenkins

 This page contains instructions to integrate a no-dashboard scan with Jenkins. This enables you to use Burp Scanner to run scans as a stage in your existing [CI/CD pipeline](https://portswigger.net/developers/ci-cd-security.html), and fail builds if issue thresholds are met.


 You configure the scan by defining a set of simple parameters in a YAML file. To learn how to configure the scan, see [Creating a configuration file for a CI-driven scan with no dashboard](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/ci-driven-no-dashboard/configuring-scans/create-config).


 These instructions have been tested with Jenkins version 2.387.3.


## Before you start

 Before you start, save the configuration for your no-dashboard scan as a YAML file. See [Creating a configuration file for a CI-driven scan with no dashboard](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/ci-driven-no-dashboard/configuring-scans/create-config).


## Jenkins server requirements

 To integrate a no-dashboard scan with Jenkins:

-
 Your Jenkins server or build node must have Docker installed.

-
 No plugins beyond the Jenkins defaults are required to run a no-dashboard scan in a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.


 For information on the machine specification required to run a no-dashboard CI/CD scanner, see [System requirements for CI-driven scan with no dashboard](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/ci-driven-no-dashboard/basic-scan#system-requirements).

## Configuring the Jenkins pipeline

1.
 From the Jenkins **Dashboard**, click **New Item**.

1.

 Enter an item name for your pipeline, click **Pipeline**, then click **OK**.

1.
 You can give your pipeline a **Description**.

1.
 From the side menu, click **Pipeline**.

1.
 From the **Definition** drop-down, select **Pipeline script from SCM**.

1.
 Configure the **Pipeline** section to point to the relevant `Jenkinsfile` in your code repository. You must include any credentials used to access the repository.

1.

 Click **Save**.

## Setting the configuration of your scan

 To set the configuration for your scan, save your configuration file as `burp_config.yml` in the root of your application.


 To learn how to create and edit the configuration file, see [Creating a configuration file for a CI-driven scan with no dashboard](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dast/setup/self-hosted/ci-driven-no-dashboard/configuring-scans/create-config).


## Creating the Jenkinsfile

 Create a `Jenkinsfile` in the corresponding location in your code repository. Add the following content to the file:
 `// Jenkinsfile for integration of a Burp Suite DAST CI-driven scan with no dashboard.

pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage ("Docker Run Example Scan") {
      steps {
        sh '''
            docker run --rm --pull=always \
            -u $(id -u) -v ${WORKSPACE}:${WORKSPACE}:rw -w ${WORKSPACE} \
            -e BURP_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=${WORKSPACE}/burp_config.yml \
            public.ecr.aws/portswigger/enterprise-scan-container:latest
        '''
      }
    }
  }
  post {
    always {
      junit testResults: 'burp_junit_report.xml', skipPublishingChecks: true, skipMarkingBuildUnstable: true, allowEmptyResults: true
        cleanWs()
    }
  }
}`

## Viewing scan results in Jenkins

 To view the results of your scan:


1.
 Access the scan results by clicking the most recent build under **Build History**.

1.
 Click **Test Result**. Here you can see any failed tests. See more details of a failed test by clicking it.


## Remediation advice

 You can see remediation advice for security issues that Burp Scanner finds under **Stacktrace**. This includes links to relevant sections of the free Web Security Academy resource, which provide further detail on web security vulnerabilities.

## Evidence

 You can see evidence for security issues that Burp Scanner finds under **Stacktrace**. This evidence includes the request sent by Burp Scanner to produce the issue, as well as the response sent by the application.
